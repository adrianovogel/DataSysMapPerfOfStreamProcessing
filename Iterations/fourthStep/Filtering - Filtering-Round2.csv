Mullen20152553,Real-time neuroimaging and cognitive monitoring using wearable dry EEG,"Goal: We present and evaluate a wearable high-density dry-electrode EEG system and an open-source software framework for online neuroimaging and state classification. Methods: The system integrates a 64-channel dry EEG form factor with wireless data streaming for online analysis. A real-time software framework is applied, including adaptive artifact rejection, cortical source localization, multivariate effective connectivity inference, data visualization, and cognitive state classification from connectivity features using a constrained logistic regression approach (ProxConn). We evaluate the system identification methods on simulated 64-channel EEG data. Then, we evaluate system performance, using ProxConn and a benchmark ERP method, in classifying response errors in nine subjects using the dry EEG system. Results: Simulations yielded high accuracy (AUC = 0.97 ± 0.021) for real-time cortical connectivity estimation. Response error classification using cortical effective connectivity [short-time direct-directed transfer function (sdDTF)] was significantly above chance with similar performance (AUC) for cLORETA (0.74 ± 0.09) and LCMV (0.72 ± 0.08) source localization. Cortical ERP-based classification was equivalent to ProxConn for cLORETA (0.74 ± 0.16) but significantly better for LCMV (0.82 ± 0.12). Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility for real-time cortical connectivity analysis and cognitive state classification from high-density wearable dry EEG. Significance: This paper is the first validated application of these methods to 64-channel dry EEG. This study addresses a need for robust real-time measurement and interpretation of complex brain activity in the dynamic environment of the wearable setting. Such advances can have broad impact in research, medicine, and brain-computer interfaces.

Le-Phuoc2011370,A native and adaptive approach for unified processing of linked streams and linked data,"In this paper we address the problem of scalable, native and adaptive query processing over Linked Stream Data integrated with Linked Data. Linked Stream Data consists of data generated by stream sources, e.g., sensors, enriched with semantic descriptions, following the standards proposed for Linked Data. This enables the integration of stream data with Linked Data collections and facilitates a wide range of novel applications. Currently available systems use a ""black box"" approach which delegates the processing to other engines such as stream/event processing engines and SPARQL query processors by translating to their provided languages. As the experimental results described in this paper show, the need for query translation and data transformation, as well as the lack of full control over the query execution, pose major drawbacks in terms of efficiency. To remedy these drawbacks, we present CQELS (Continuous Query Evaluation over Linked Streams), a native and adaptive query processor for unified query processing over Linked Stream Data and Linked Data. In contrast to the existing systems, CQELS uses a ""white box"" approach and implements the required query operators natively to avoid the overhead and limitations of closed system regimes. CQELS provides a flexible query execution framework with the query processor dynamically adapting to the changes in the input data. During query execution, it continuously reorders operators according to some heuristics to achieve improved query execution in terms of delay and complexity. Moreover, external disk access on large Linked Data collections is reduced with the use of data encoding and caching of intermediate query results. To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, we present extensive experimental performance evaluations in terms of query execution time, under varied query types, dataset sizes, and number of parallel queries. These results show that CQELS outperforms related approaches by orders of magnitude. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Le-Phuoc, D. and Dao-Tran, M. and XavierParreira, J. and Hauswirth, M.",2011,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_24,scopus-search1.bib
Fernandez2013725,Integrating scale out and fault tolerance in stream processing using operator state management,"As users of ""big data"" applications expect fresh results, we witness a new breed of stream processing systems (SPS) that are designed to scale to large numbers of cloud-hosted machines. Such systems face new challenges: (i) to benefit from the ""pay-as-you-go"" model of cloud computing, they must scale out on demand, acquiring additional virtual machines (VMs) and parallelising operators when the workload increases; (ii) failures are common with deployments on hundreds of VMs - systems must be fault-tolerant with fast recovery times, yet low per-machine overheads. An open question is how to achieve these two goals when stream queries include stateful operators, which must be scaled out and recovered without affecting query results. Our key idea is to expose internal operator state explicitly to the SPS through a set of state management primitives. Based on them, we describe an integrated approach for dynamic scale out and recovery of stateful operators. Externalised operator state is checkpointed periodically by the SPS and backed up to upstream VMs. The SPS identifies individual operator bottlenecks and automatically scales them out by allocating new VMs and partitioning the check-pointed state. At any point, failed operators are recovered by restoring checkpointed state on a new VM and replaying unprocessed tuples. We evaluate this approach with the Linear Road Benchmark on the Amazon EC2 cloud platform and show that it can scale automatically to a load factor of L=350 with 50 VMs, while recovering quickly from failures.

Baccarelli20179882,"Fog of Everything: Energy-Efficient Networked Computing Architectures, Research Challenges, and a Case Study","Fog computing (FC) and Internet of Everything (IoE) are two emerging technological paradigms that, to date, have been considered standing-alone. However, because of their complementary features, we expect that their integration can foster a number of computing and network-intensive pervasive applications under the incoming realm of the future Internet. Motivated by this consideration, the goal of this position paper is fivefold. First, we review the technological attributes and platforms proposed in the current literature for the standing-alone FC and IoE paradigms. Second, by leveraging some use cases as illustrative examples, we point out that the integration of the FC and IoE paradigms may give rise to opportunities for new applications in the realms of the IoE, Smart City, Industry 4.0, and Big Data Streaming, while introducing new open issues. Third, we propose a novel technological paradigm, the Fog of Everything (FoE) paradigm, that integrates FC and IoE and then we detail the main building blocks and services of the corresponding technological platform and protocol stack. Fourth, as a proof-of-concept, we present the simulated energy-delay performance of a small-scale FoE prototype, namely, the V-FoE prototype. Afterward, we compare the obtained performance with the corresponding one of a benchmark technological platform, e.g., the V-D2D one. It exploits only device-to-device links to establish inter-thing 'ad hoc' communication. Last, we point out the position of the proposed FoE paradigm over a spectrum of seemingly related recent research projects. © 2017 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Baccarelli, E. and Naranjo, P.G.V. and Scarpiniti, M. and Shojafar, M. and Abawajy, J.H.",2017,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2702013,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Chintapalli20161789,"Benchmarking streaming computation engines: Storm, flink and spark streaming","Streaming data processing has been gaining attention due to its application into a wide range of scenarios. To serve the booming demands of streaming data processing, many computation engines have been developed. However, there is still a lack of real-world benchmarks that would be helpful when choosing the most appropriate platform for serving real-time streaming needs. In order to address this problem, we developed a streaming benchmark for three representative computation engines: Flink, Storm and Spark Streaming. Instead of testing speed-of-light event processing, we construct a full data pipeline using Kafka and Redis in order to more closely mimic the real-world production scenarios.

Jain2006431,"Design, implementation, and evaluation of the linear road bnchmark on the stream processing core","Stream processing applications have recently gained significant attention in the networking and database community. At the core of these applications is a stream processing engine that performs resource allocation and management to support continuous tracking of queries over collections of physically- distributed and rapidly-updating data streams. While numerous stream processing systems exist, there has been little work on understanding the performance characteristics of these applications in a distributed setup. In this paper, we examine the performance bottlenecks of streaming data applications, in particular the Linear Road stream data management benchmark, in achieving good performance in large-scale distributed environments, using the Stream Processing Core (SPC), a stream processing middleware we have developed. First, we present the design and implementation of the Linear Road benchmark on the SPC middleware. SPC has been designed to scale to tens of thousands of processing nodes, while supporting concurrent applications and multiple simultaneous queries. Second, we identify the main performance bottlenecks in the Linear Road application in achieving scalability and low query response latency. Our results show that data locality, buffer capacity, physical allocation of processing elements to infrastructure nodes, and packaging for transporting streamed data are important factors in achieving good application performance. Though we evaluate our system primarily for the Linear Road application, we believe it also provides useful insights into the overall system behavior for supporting other distributed and large-scale continuous streaming data applications. Finally, we examine how SPC can be used and tuned to enable a very efficient implementation of the Linear Road application in a distributed environment.

Peng2015149,R-storm: Resource-aware scheduling in storm,"The era of big data has led to the emergence of new systems for real-time distributed stream processing, e.g., Apache Storm is one of the most popular stream processing systems in in- dustry today. However, Storm, like many other stream pro- cessing systems lacks an intelligent scheduling mechanism. The default round-robin scheduling currently deployed in Storm disregards resource demands and availability, and can therefore be inefficient at times. We present R-Storm (Resource-Aware Storm), a system that implements resource- aware scheduling within Storm. R-Storm is designed to in- crease overall throughput by maximizing resource utilization while minimizing network latency. When scheduling tasks, R-Storm can satisfy both soft and hard resource constraints as well as minimizing network distance between components that communicate with each other. We evaluate R-Storm on set of micro-benchmark Storm applications as well as Storm applications used in production at Yahoo! Inc. From our experimental results we conclude that R-Storm achieves 30-47% higher throughput and 69-350% better CPU utiliza- tion than default Storm for the micro-benchmarks. For the Yahoo! Storm applications, R-Storm outperforms default Storm by around 50% based on overall throughput. We also demonstrate that R-Storm performs much better when scheduling multiple Storm applications than default Storm. © 2015 ACM.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Peng, B. and Hosseini, M. and Hong, Z. and Farivar, R. and Campbell, R.",2015,Middleware 2015 - Proceedings of the 16th Annual Middleware Conference,10.1145/2814576.2814808,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;acm1-search1.bib
Eager2001742,Minimizing bandwidth requirements for on-demand data delivery,"Two recent techniques for multicast or broadcast delivery of streaming media can provide immediate service to each client request, yet achieve considerable client stream sharing which leads to significant server and network bandwidth savings. This paper considers 1) how well these recently proposed techniques perform relative to each other and 2) whether there are new practical delivery techniques that can achieve better bandwidth savings than the previous techniques over a wide range of client request rates. The principal results are as follows: First, the recent partitioned dynamic skyscraper technique is adapted to provide immediate service to each client request more simply and directly than the original dynamic skyscraper method. Second, at moderate to high client request rates, the dynamic skyscraper method has required server bandwidth that is significantly lower than the recent optimized stream tapping/patching/controlled multicast technique. Third, the minimum required server bandwidth for any delivery technique that provides immediate real-time delivery to clients increases logarithmically (with constant factor equal to one) as a function of the client request arrival rate. Furthermore, it is (theoretically) possible to achieve very close to the minimum required server bandwidth if client receive bandwidth is equal to two times the data streaming rate and client storage capacity is sufficient for buffering data from shared streams. Finally, we propose a new practical delivery technique, called hierarchical multicast stream merging (HMSM), which has a required server bandwidth that is lower than the partitioned dynamic skyscraper and is reasonably close to the minimum achievable required server bandwidth over a wide range of client request rates.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Eager, D. and Vernon, M. and Zahorjan, J.",2001,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,10.1109/69.956098,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib

Green2004752,Processing XML streams with deterministic automata and stream indexes,"We consider the problem of evaluating a large number of XPath expressions on a stream of XML packets. We contribute two novel techniques. The first is to use a single Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The contribution here is to show that the DFA can be used effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a constant throughput, independently of the number of XPath expressions. The major issue is the size of the DFA, which, in theory, can be exponential in the number of XPath expressions. We provide a series of theoretical results and experimental evaluations that show that the lazy DFA has a small number of states, for all practical purposes. These results are of general interest in XPath processing, beyond stream processing. The second technique is the Streaming IndeX (SLK), which consists of adding a small amount of binary data to each XML packet that allows the query processor to achieve significant speedups.

The model is inspired by our empirical study on a trace from a large-scale production data-processing cluster; it allows a set of effective query optimizations that are not possible in a traditional batch processing model. We have developed a query processing system called Comet that embraces batched stream processing and integrates with DryadLINQ. We used two complementary methods to evaluate the effectiveness of optimizations that Comet enables.

Cardellini2016271,On QoS-Aware scheduling of data stream applications over fog computing infrastructures,"Fog computing is rapidly changing the distributed computing landscape by extending the Cloud computing paradigm to include wide-spread resources located at the network edges. This diffused infrastructure is well suited for the implementation of data stream processing (DSP) applications, by possibly exploiting local computing resources. Storm is an open source, scalable, and fault-Tolerant DSP system designed for locally distributed clusters. We made it suitable to operate in a geographically distributed and highly variable environment; to this end, we extended Storm with new components that allow to execute a distributed QoS-Aware scheduler and give self-Adaptation capabilities to the system. In this paper we provide a thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed solution using two sets of DSP applications: The former is characterized by a simple topology with different requirements; the latter comprises some well known applications (i.e., Word Count, Log Processing). The results show that the distributed QoS-Aware scheduler outperforms the centralized default one, improving the application performance and enhancing the system with runtime adaptation capabilities.

While first initiatives try to compare the systems for simple workloads, there is a clear gap of detailed analyses of the systems' performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework for benchmarking distributed stream processing engines. We use our suite to evaluate the performance of three widely used SDPSs in detail, namely Apache Storm, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink. Our evaluation focuses in particular on measuring the throughput and latency of windowed operations, which are the basic type of operations in stream analytics. For this benchmark, we design workloads based on real-life, industrial use-cases inspired by the online gaming industry. The contribution of our work is threefold. First, we give a definition of latency and throughput for stateful operators. Second, we carefully separate the system under test and driver, in order to correctly represent the open world model of typical stream processing deployments and can, therefore, measure system performance under realistic conditions.

We introduce a model for estimating the latency of a data flow, when the degrees of parallelism of the tasks within are changed. We describe how to continuously measure the necessary performance metrics for the model, and how it can be used to enforce latency guarantees, by determining appropriate scaling actions at runtime. Therefore, it leverages the elasticity inherent to common cloud technology and cluster resource management systems. We have implemented our strategy as part of the Nephele SPE.

Venkataraman2017374,Drizzle: Fast and Adaptable Stream Processing at Scale,"Large scale streaming systems aim to provide high throughput and low latency. They are often used to run mission-critical applications, and must be available 24x7. Thus such systems need to adapt to failures and inherent changes in workloads, with minimal impact on latency and throughput. Unfortunately, existing solutions require operators to choose between achieving low latency during normal operation and incurring minimal impact during adaptation. Continuous operator streaming systems, such as Naiad and Flink, provide low latency during normal execution but incur high overheads during adaptation (e.g., recovery), while micro-batch systems, such as Spark Streaming and FlumeJava, adapt rapidly at the cost of high latency during normal operations. Our key observation is that while streaming workloads require millisecond-level processing, workload and cluster properties change less frequently. Based on this, we develop Drizzle, a system that decouples the processing interval from the coordination interval used for fault tolerance and adaptability. Our experiments on a 128 node EC2 cluster show that on the Yahoo Streaming Benchmark, Drizzle can achieve end-to-end record processing latencies of less than 100ms and can get 2–3x lower latency than Spark. Drizzle also exhibits better adaptability, and can recover from failures 4x faster than Flink while having up to 13x lower latency during recovery. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In this paper, a systematic review of big data streams analysis which employed a rigorous and methodical approach to look at the trends of big data stream tools and technologies as well as methods and techniques employed in analysing big data streams. It provides a global view of big data stream tools and technologies and its comparisons. Three major databases, Scopus, ScienceDirect and EBSCO, which indexes journals and conferences that are promoted by entities such as IEEE, ACM, SpringerLink, and Elsevier were explored as data sources.

The study found that scalability, privacy and load balancing issues as well as empirical analysis of big data streams and technologies are still open for further research efforts. We also found that although, significant research efforts have been directed to real-time analysis of big data stream not much attention has been given to the preprocessing stage of big data streams. Only a few big data streaming tools and technologies can do all of the batch, streaming, and iterative jobs; there seems to be no big data tool and technology that offers all the key features required for now and standard benchmark dataset for big data streaming analytics has not been widely adopted.

Feng2008269,On large-scale peer-to-peer streaming Systems with Network Coding,"Live peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming has recently received much research attention, with successful commercial systems showing its viability in the Internet. Nevertheless, existing analytical studies of P2P streaming systems have failed to mathematically investigate and understand their critical properties, especially with a large scale and under extreme dynamics such as a flash crowd scenario. Even more importantly, there exists no prior analytical work that focuses on an entirely new way of designing streaming protocols, with the help of network coding. In this paper, we seek to show an in-depth analytical understanding of fundamental properties of P2P streaming systems, with a particular spotlight on the benefits of network coding. We show that, if network coding is used according to certain design principles, provably good performance can be guaranteed, with respect to high playback qualities, short initial buffering delays, resilience to peer dynamics, as well as minimal bandwidth costs on dedicated streaming servers. Our results are obtained with mathematical rigor, but without sacrificing realistic assumptions of system scale, peer dynamics, and upload capacities. For further insights, streaming systems using network coding are compared with traditional pull-based streaming in large-scale simulations, with a focus on fundamentals, rather than protocol details. The scale of our simulations throughout this paper exceeds 200, 000 peers at times, which is in sharp contrast with existing empirical studies, typically with a few hundred peers involved.

But the efficacy and performance of contemporary DSPS have not been rigorously studied for IoT applications and data streams. Here, we propose RIoTBench, a real-time IoT benchmark suite, along with performance metrics, to evaluate DSPS for streaming IoT applications. The benchmark includes 27 common IoT tasks classified across various functional categories and implemented as modular microbenchmarks. Further, we define four IoT application benchmarks composed from these tasks based on common patterns of data preprocessing, statistical summarization, and predictive analytics that are intrinsic to the closed-loop IoT decision-making life cycle. These are coupled with four stream workloads sourced from real IoT observations on smart cities and smart health, with peak streams rates that range from 500 to 10 000 messages/second from up to 3 million sensors. We validate the RIoTBench suite for the popular Apache Storm DSPS on the Microsoft Azure public cloud and present empirical observations. This suite can be used by DSPS researchers for performance analysis and resource scheduling, by IoT practitioners to evaluate DSPS platforms, and even reused within IoT solutions.

Lu201469,Stream bench: Towards benchmarking modern distributed stream computing frameworks,"While big data is becoming ubiquitous, interest in handling data stream at scale is also gaining popularity, which leads to the sprout of many distributed stream computing systems. However, complexity of stream computing and diversity of workloads expose great challenges to benchmark these systems. Due to lack of standard criteria, evaluations and comparisons of these systems tend to be difficult. This paper takes an early step towards benchmarking modern distributed stream computing frameworks. After identifying the challenges and requirements in the field, we raise our benchmark definition Stream Bench regarding the requirements. Stream Bench proposes a message system functioning as a mediator between stream data generation and consumption. It also covers 7 benchmark programs that intend to address typical stream computing scenarios and core operations. Not only does it care about performance of systems under different data scales, but also takes fault tolerance ability and durability into account, which drives to incorporate four workload suites targeting at these various aspects of systems. Finally, we illustrate the feasibility of Stream Bench by applying it to two popular frameworks, Apache Storm and Apache Spark Streaming. We draw comparisons from various perspectives between the two platforms with workload suites of Stream Bench. In addition, we also demonstrate performance improvement of Storm's latest version with the benchmark. © 2014 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,INCLUDED,INCLUDED,,,"Lu, R. and Wu, G. and Xie, B. and Hu, J.",2014,"Proceedings - 2014 IEEE/ACM 7th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, UCC 2014",10.1109/UCC.2014.15,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib;acm1-search1.bib
Zhang20162114,Parallel Processing Systems for Big Data: A Survey,"The volume, variety, and velocity properties of big data and the valuable information it contains have motivated the investigation of many new parallel data processing systems in addition to the approaches using traditional database management systems (DBMSs). MapReduce pioneered this paradigm change and rapidly became the primary big data processing system for its simplicity, scalability, and fine-grain fault tolerance. However, compared with DBMSs, MapReduce also arouses controversy in processing efficiency, low-level abstraction, and rigid dataflow. Inspired by MapReduce, nowadays the big data systems are blooming. Some of them follow MapReduce's idea, but with more flexible models for general-purpose usage. Some absorb the advantages of DBMSs with higher abstraction. There are also specific systems for certain applications, such as machine learning and stream data processing. To explore new research opportunities and assist users in selecting suitable processing systems for specific applications, this survey paper will give a high-level overview of the existing parallel data processing systems categorized by the data input as batch processing, stream processing, graph processing, and machine learning processing and introduce representative projects in each category. As the pioneer, the original MapReduce system, as well as its active variants and extensions on dataflow, data access, parameter tuning, communication, and energy optimizations will be discussed at first.

Chen2013,Measurement and modeling of video watching time in a large-scale internet video-on-demand system,"Video watching time is a crucial measure for studying user watching behavior in online Internet video-on-demand (VoD) systems. It is important for system planning, user engagement understanding, and system quality evaluation. However, due to the limited access of user data in large-scale streaming systems, a systematic measurement, analysis, and modeling of video watching time is still missing. In this paper, we measure PPLive, one of the most popular commercial Internet VoD systems in China, over a three week period. We collect accurate user watching data of more than 100 million streaming sessions of more than 100 thousand distinct videos. Based on the measurement data, we characterize the distribution of watching time of different types of videos and reveal a number of interesting characteristics regarding the relation between video watching time and various video-related features (including video type, duration, and popularity). We further build a suite of mathematical models for characterizing these relationships. Extensive performance evaluation shows the high accuracy of these models as compared with commonly used data-mining based models.

The intent is to provide a better understanding of supersonic jet noise generation mechanisms and high intensity propagation for both commercial and military engines. Although high exhaust stream Mach number studies are available to researchers, these are usually limited in temperature and velocity capability by today's model scale test facilities. A series of full scale engine noise measurements were, therefore, conducted using ground plane microphones in the geometric near field below the engine, far field microphones extending to over 300 engine diameters, and, a 30 microphone phased array. This diagnostic configuration provided: a) engine noise directivity and OASPL dependence on exhaust conditions, b) acoustic spectra and propagation decay in the peak directivity angle, c) acoustic source distribution characteristics in the jet axial direction, and d) impulsive acoustic signature dependence on exhaust conditions and variation with propagation distance.

Luckow20151201,"Automotive big data: Applications, workloads and infrastructures","Data is increasingly affecting the automotive industry, from vehicle development, to manufacturing and service processes, to online services centered around the connected vehicle. Connected, mobile and Internet of Things devices and machines generate immense amounts of sensor data. The ability to process and analyze this data to extract insights and knowledge that enable intelligent services, new ways to understand business problems, improvements of processes and decisions, is a critical capability. Hadoop is a scalable platform for compute and storage and emerged as de-facto standard for Big Data processing at Internet companies and in the scientific community. However, there is a lack of understanding of how and for what use cases these new Hadoop capabilities can be efficiently used to augment automotive applications and systems. This paper surveys use cases and applications for deploying Hadoop in the automotive industry. Over the years a rich ecosystem emerged around Hadoop comprising tools for parallel, in-memory and stream processing (most notable MapReduce and Spark), SQL and NOSQL engines (Hive, HBase), and machine learning (Mahout, MLlib). It is critical to develop an understanding of automotive applications and their characteristics and requirements for data discovery, integration, exploration and analytics. We then map these requirements to a confined technical architecture consisting of core Hadoop services and libraries for data ingest, processing and analytics. The objective of this paper is to address questions, such as: What applications and datasets are suitable for Hadoop? How can a diverse set of frameworks and tools be managed on multi-tenant Hadoop cluster? How do these tools integrate with existing relational data management systems? How can enterprise security requirements be addressed? What are the performance characteristics of these tools for real-world automotive applications?

Lin2015811,Scalable distributed stream join processing,"Efficient and scalable stream joins play an important role in performing real-time analytics for many cloud applications. However, like in conventional database processing, online theta-joins over data streams are computationally expensive and moreover, being memory-based processing, they impose high memory requirement on the system. In this paper, we propose a novel stream join model, called join-biclique, which organizes a large cluster as a complete bipartite graph. Join-biclique has several strengths over state-of-the-art techniques, including memory-efficiency, elasticity and scalability. These features are essential for building efficient and scalable streaming systems. Based on join-biclique, we develop a scalable distributed stream join system, BiStream, over a large-scale commodity cluster. Specifically, BiStream is designed to support efficient full-history joins, windowbased joins and online data aggregation. BiStream also supports adaptive resource management to dynamically scale out and down the system according to its application workloads. We provide both theoretical cost analysis and extensive experimental evaluations to evaluate the efficiency, elasticity and scalability of BiStream.

In addition, a design with high link utilization can achieve high stream rates, supporting high-quality video. Until now, only tree-based designs have been shown to achieve close-to-optimal rates in real-life conditions, leaving the question open as to the attainable efficiency of completely unstructured mesh-based approaches. In this paper we answer that question by showing that a carefully-designed mesh-based system can achieve close-to-optimal stream rates. Specifically, we implement and evaluate a design based on a mesh-based algorithm called DP/LU. Contrary to tree-based designs, DP/LU uses an unstructured overlay, which is easier to construct and is highly resistant to churn. In addition, we introduce mechanisms for overlay rewiring and source scheduling that lead to significant performance improvements. Our experimental evaluation shows that our design achieves 95% of the maximum achievable stream rate in a static environment, and 90% under high churn.

S-Store is a data management system that combines OLTP transactions with stream processing. To create S-Store, we begin with H-Store, a main-memory transaction processing engine, and add primitives to support streaming. This includes triggers and transaction workflows to implement push-based processing, windows to provide a way to bound the computation, and tables with hidden state to implement scoping for proper isolation. This demo explores the benefits of this approach by showing how a naïve implementation of our benchmarks using only H-Store can yield incorrect results.

Moreover, to better exploit the abundance of diffused computational resources (e.g., Fog computing), recent trends investigate the possibility of decentralizing the DSP application placement. In this paper, we present and evaluate a general formulation of the optimal DSP replication and placement (ODRP) as an integer linear programming problem, which takes into account the heterogeneity of application requirements and infrastructural resources.

Zeitler20111181,Massive scale-out of expensive continuous queries,"Scalable execution of expensive continuous queries over massive data streams requires input streams to be split into parallel substreams. The query operators are continuously executed in parallel over these sub-streams. Stream splitting involves both partitioning and replication of incoming tuples, depending on how the continuous query is parallelized. We provide a stream splitting operator that enables such customized stream splitting. However, it is critical that the stream splitting itself keeps up with input streams of high volume. This is a problem when the stream splitting predicates have some costs. Therefore, to enable customized splitting of high-volume streams, we introduce a parallelized stream splitting operator, called parasplit. We investigate the performance of parasplit using a cost model and experimentally. Based on these results, a heuristic is devised to automatically parallelize the execution of parasplit. We show that the maximum stream rate of parasplit is network bound, and that the parallelization is energy efficient. Finally, the scalability of our approach is experimentally demonstrated on the Linear Road Benchmark, showing an order of magnitude higher stream processing rate over previously published results, allowing at least 512 expressways. © 2011 VLDB Endowment.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Zeitler, E. and Risch, T.",2011,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,,scopus-search1.bib

To keep up with the high volume of daily produced data, these applications need to dynamically scale their execution on multiple computing nodes, so to process the incoming data flow in parallel. In this paper, we present a hierarchical distributed architecture for the autonomous control of elastic DSP applications. It consists of a two-layered hierarchical solution, where a centralized per-application component coordinates the run-time adaptation of subordinated distributed components, which, in turn, locally control the adaptation of single DSP operators. Thanks to its features, the proposed solution can efficiently run in large-scale Fog computing environments. Exploiting this framework, we design several distributed self-adaptation policies, including a popular threshold-based approach and two reinforcement learning solutions. We integrate the hierarchical architecture and the devised self-adaptation policies in Apache Storm, a popular open-source DSP framework. Relying on the DEBS 2015 Grand Challenge as a benchmark application, we show the benefits of the presented self-adaptation policies, and discuss the strengths of reinforcement learning based approaches, which autonomously learn from experience how to optimize the application performance.

Zeuch2018516,Analyzing Efficient Stream Processing on Modern Hardware,"Modern Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) process large data volumes under tight latency constraints. Many SPEs execute processing pipelines using message passing on sharednothing architectures and apply a partition-based scale-out strategy to handle high-velocity input streams. Furthermore, many state-of-the-art SPEs rely on a Java Virtual Machine to achieve platform independence and speed up system development by abstracting from the underlying hardware. In this paper, we show that taking the underlying hardware into account is essential to exploit modern hardware efficiently. To this end, we conduct an extensive experimental analysis of current SPEs and SPE design alternatives optimized for modern hardware. Our analysis highlights potential bottlenecks and reveals that state-of-the-art SPEs are not capable of fully exploiting current and emerging hardware trends, such as multi-core processors and high-speed networks. Based on our analysis, we describe a set of design changes to the common architecture of SPEs to scale-up on modern hardware. We show that the single-node throughput can be increased by up to two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art SPEs by applying specialized code generation, fusing operators, batch-style parallelization strategies, and optimized windowing.

Kumbhare2015105,Reactive resource provisioning heuristics for dynamic dataflows on cloud infrastructure,"The need for low latency analysis over high-velocity data streams motivates the need for distributed continuous dataflow systems. Contemporary stream processing systems use simple techniques to scale on elastic cloud resources to handle variable data rates. However, application QoS is also impacted by variability in resource performance exhibited by clouds and hence necessitates autonomic methods of provisioning elastic resources to support such applications on cloud infrastructure. We develop the concept of 'dynamic dataflows' which utilize alternate tasks as additional control over the dataflow's cost and QoS. Further, we formalize an optimization problem to represent deployment and runtime resource provisioning that allows us to balance the application's QoS, value, and the resource cost. We propose two greedy heuristics, centralized and sharded, based on the variable-sized bin packing algorithm and compare against a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based heuristic that gives a near-optimal solution. A large-scale simulation study, using the linear road benchmark and VM performance traces from the AWS public cloud, shows that while GA-based heuristic provides a better quality schedule, the greedy heuristics are more practical, and can intelligently utilize cloud elasticity to mitigate the effect of variability, both in input data rates and cloud resource performance, to meet the QoS of fast data applications. © 2013 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Kumbhare, A.G. and Simmhan, Y. and Frincu, M. and Prasanna, V.K.",2015,IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing,10.1109/TCC.2015.2394316,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee1-search1.bib
Zhao2006298,Finding global icebergs over distributed data sets,"Finding icebergs-items whose frequency of occurrence is above a certain threshold-is an important problem with a wide range of applications. Most of the existing work focuses on iceberg queries at a single node. However, in many real-life applications, data sets are distributed across a large number of nodes. Two naïve approaches might be considered. In the first, each node ships its entire data set to a central server, and the central server uses single-node algorithms to find icebergs. But it may incur prohibitive communication overhead. In the second, each node submits local icebergs, and the central server combines local icebergs to find global icebergs. But it may fail because in many important applications, globally frequent items may not be frequent at any node. In this work, we propose two novel schemes that provide accurate and efficient solutions to this problem: a sampling-based scheme and a counting-sketch-based scheme. In particular, the latter scheme incurs a communication cost at least an order of magnitude smaller than the naïve scheme of shipping all data, yet is able to achieve very high accuracy. Through rigorous theoretical and experimental analysis we establish the statistical properties of our proposed algorithms, including their accuracy bounds.

It is the general problem of extracting data of interest from a data source, a problem that the database community,has successfully addressed with SOL queries, a time tested, user-friendly way for, noncomputer scientists to access data. By leveraging the efficiency of query processing provided by relational queries, the dQUOB system provides a conceptual relational data model and SOL query access over streaming data. Queries can be used to extract data, combine streams, and create hew streams. The. language augments queries with an action to enable more complex data. transformations such as Fourier transforms. The dQUOB system has been applied to two large-scale distributed applications: a safety critical autonomous robotics simulation and scientific software visualization for global atmospheric transport modeling.

Nardelli20191753,Efficient Operator Placement for Distributed Data Stream Processing Applications,"In the last few years, a large number of real-time analytics applications rely on the Data Stream Processing (DSP) so to extract, in a timely manner, valuable information from distributed sources. Moreover, to efficiently handle the increasing amount of data, recent trends exploit the emerging presence of edge/Fog computing resources so to decentralize the execution of DSP applications. Since determining the Optimal DSP Placement (for short, ODP) is an NP-hard problem, we need efficient heuristics that can identify a good application placement on the computing infrastructure in a feasible amount of time, even for large problem instances. In this paper, we present several DSP placement heuristics that consider the heterogeneity of computing and network resources; we divide them in two main groups: model-based and model-free. The former employ different strategies for efficiently solving the ODP model. The latter implement, for the problem at hand, some of the well-known meta-heuristics, namely greedy first-fit, local search, and tabu search. By leveraging on ODP, we conduct a thorough experimental evaluation, aimed to assess the heuristics' efficiency and efficacy under different configurations of infrastructure size, application topology, and optimization objectives. © 2019 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Nardelli, M. and Cardellini, V. and Grassi, V. and LoPresti, F.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,10.1109/TPDS.2019.2896115,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee1-search1.bib
Zacheilas2015213,Elastic complex event processing exploiting prediction,"Supporting real-time, cost-effective execution of Complex Event processing applications in the cloud has been an important goal for many scientists in recent years. Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS) have been widely adopted by major computing companies as a powerful approach for large-scale Complex Event processing (CEP). However, determining the appropriate degree of parallelism of the DSPS' components can be particularly challenging as the volume of data streams is becoming increasingly large, the rule set is becoming continuously complex, and the system must be able to handle such large data stream volumes in real-time, taking into consideration changes in the burstiness levels and data characteristics. In this paper we describe our solution to building elastic complex event processing systems on top of our distributed CEP system which combines two commonly used frameworks, Storm and Esper, in order to provide both ease of usage and scalability. Our approach makes the following contributions: (i) we provide a mechanism for predicting the load and latency of the Esper engines in upcoming time windows, and (ii) we propose a novel algorithm for automatically adjusting the number of engines to use in the upcoming windows, taking into account the cost and the performance gains of possible changes. Our detailed experimental evaluation with a real traffic monitoring application that analyzes bus traces from the city of Dublin indicates the benefits in the working of our approach.

Mueller2013,Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP/2.0,"MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is a new streaming standard that has been recently ratified as an international standard (IS). In comparison to other streaming systems, e.g., HTTP progressive download, DASH is able to handle varying bandwidth conditions providing smooth streaming. Furthermore, it enables NAT and Firewall traversal, flexible and scalable deployment as well as reduced infrastructure costs due to the reuse of existing Internet infrastructure components, e.g., proxies, caches, and Content Distribution Networks (CDN). Recently, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Bis (httpbis) working group of the IETF has officially started the development of HTTP 2.0. Initially three major proposals have been submitted to the IETF i.e., Googles' SPDY, Microsofts' HTTP Speed+Mobility and Network-Friendly HTTP Upgrade, but SPDY has been chosen as working draft for HTTP 2.0. In this paper we implemented MPEG-DASH over HTTP 2.0 (i.e., SPDY), demonstrating its potential benefits and drawbacks. Moreover, several experimental evaluations have been performed that compare HTTP 2.0 with HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 1.0 in the context of DASH.

Our benchmarks use the same Mahout backend code, ensuring a fair comparison. The differences between these implementations stem from how the Hadoop and Granules runtimes (1) support and manage the lifecycle of individual computations, and (2) how they orchestrate exchange of data between different stages of the computational pipeline during successive iterations of the clustering algorithm.

Kalyvianaki2011840,SQPR: Stream query planning with reuse,"When users submit new queries to a distributed stream processing system (DSPS), a query planner must allocate physical resources, such as CPU cores, memory and network bandwidth, from a set of hosts to queries. Allocation decisions must provide the correct mix of resources required by queries, while achieving an efficient overall allocation to scale in the number of admitted queries. By exploiting overlap between queries and reusing partial results, a query planner can conserve resources but has to carry out more complex planning decisions. In this paper, we describe SQPR, a query planner that targets DSPSs in data centre environments with heterogeneous resources. SQPR models query admission, allocation and reuse as a single constrained optimisation problem and solves an approximate version to achieve scalability. It prevents individual resources from becoming bottlenecks by re-planning past allocation decisions and supports different allocation objectives. As our experimental evaluation in comparison with a state-of-the-art planner shows SQPR makes efficient resource allocation decisions, even with a high utilisation of resources, with acceptable overheads. © 2011 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Kalyvianaki, E. and Wiesemann, W. and Vu, Q.H. and Kuhn, D. and Pietzuch, P.",2011,Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering,10.1109/ICDE.2011.5767851,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee1-search1.bib
Gu2006824,On composing stream applications in peer-to-peer environments,"Stream processing has become increasingly important as many emerging applications call for continuous real-time processing over data streams, such as voice-over-IP telephony, security surveillance, and sensor data analysis. In this paper, we propose a composable stream processing system for cooperative peer-to-peer environments. The system can dynamically select and compose stream processing elements located on different peers into user desired applications. We investigate multiple alternative approaches to composing stream applications: 1) global-state-based centralized versus local-state-based distributed algorithms for initially composing stream applications at setup phase. The centralized algorithm performs periodical global state maintenance while the distributed algorithm performs on-demand state collection. 2) Reactive versus proactive failure recovery schemes for maintaining composed stream applications during runtime. The reactive failure recovery algorithm dynamically recomposes a new stream application upon failures while the proactive approach maintains a number of backup compositions for failure recovery. We conduct both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations to study the properties of different approaches. Our study illustrates the performance and overhead trade-offs among different design alternatives, which can provide important guidance for selecting proper algorithms to compose stream applications in cooperative peer-to-peer environments. © 2006 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Gu, X. and Nahrstedt, K.",2006,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,10.1109/TPDS.2006.107,scopus-search1.bib

Due to the unpredictability of data sources, these applications often operate in dynamic environments; therefore, they require the ability to elastically scale in response to workload variations. In this paper, we deal with a key problem for the effective runtime management of a DSP application in geo-distributed environments: We investigate the placement and replication decisions while considering the application and resource heterogeneity and the migration overhead, so to select the optimal adaptation strategy that can minimize migration costs while satisfying the application quality of service (QoS) requirements. We present elastic DSP replication and placement (EDRP), a unified framework for the QoS-aware initial deployment and runtime elasticity management of DSP applications. In EDRP, the deployment and runtime decisions are driven by the solution of a suitable integer linear programming problem, whose objective function captures the relative importance between QoS goals and reconfiguration costs.

Tournavitis2010377,Semi-automatic extraction and exploitation of hierarchical pipeline parallelism using profiling information,"In recent years multi-core computer systems have left the realm of high-performance computing and virtually all of today's desktop computers and embedded computing systems are equipped with several processing cores. Still, no single parallel programming model has found widespread support and parallel programming remains an art for the majority of application programmers. In addition, there exists a plethora of sequential legacy applications for which automatic parallelization is the only hope to benefit from the increased processing power of modern multi-core systems. In the past automatic parallelization largely focused on data parallelism. In this paper we present a novel approach to extracting and exploiting pipeline parallelism from sequential applications. We use profiling to overcome the limitations of static data and control flow analysis enabling more aggressive parallelization. Our approach is orthogonal to existing automatic parallelization approaches and additional data parallelism may be exploited in the individual pipeline stages. The key contribution of this paper is a whole-program representation that supports profiling, parallelism extraction and exploitation. We demonstrate how this enhances conventional pipeline parallelization by incorporating support for multi-level loops and pipeline stage replication in a uniform and automatic way.

Shukla201898,Model-driven scheduling for distributed stream processing systems,"Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS) are ``Fast Data{''} platforms that allow streaming applications to be composed and executed with low latency on commodity clusters and Clouds. Such applications are composed as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks, with data parallel execution using concurrent task threads on distributed resource slots. Scheduling such DAGs for DSPS has two parts-allocation of threads and resources for a DAG, and mapping threads to resources. Existing schedulers often address just one of these, make the assumption that performance linearly scales, or use ad hoc empirical tuning at runtime. Instead, we propose model-driven techniques for both mapping and allocation that rely on low-overhead a priori performance modeling of tasks. Our scheduling algorithms are able to offer predictable and low resource needs that is suitable for elastic pay-as-you-go Cloud resources, support a high input rate through high VM utilization, and can be combined with other mapping approaches as well.

Khoshkbarforoushha2017120,Distribution Based Workload Modelling of Continuous Queries in Clouds,"Resource usage estimation for managing streaming workload in emerging applications domains such as enterprise computing, smart cities, remote healthcare, and astronomy, has emerged as a challenging research problem. Such resource estimation for processing continuous queries over streaming data is challenging due to: (i) uncertain stream arrival patterns, (ii) need to process different mixes of queries, and (iii) varying resource consumption. Existing techniques approximate resource usage for a query as a single point value which may not be sufficient because it is neither expressive enough nor does it capture the aforementioned nature of streaming workload. In this paper, we present a novel approach of using mixture density networks to estimate the whole spectrum of resource usage as probability density functions. We have evaluated our technique using the linear road benchmark and TPC-H in both private and public clouds. The efficiency and applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated via two novel applications: i) predictable auto-scaling policy setting which highlights the potential of distribution prediction in consistent definition of cloud elasticity rules; and ii) a distribution based admission controller which is able to efficiently admit or reject incoming queries based on probabilistic service level agreements compliance goals. © 2013 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Khoshkbarforoushha, A. and Ranjan, R. and Gaire, R. and Abbasnejad, E. and Wang, L. and Zomaya, A.Y.",2017,IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing,10.1109/TETC.2016.2597546,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib
Ed-daoudy2019,A new Internet of Things architecture for real-time prediction of various diseases using machine learning on big data environment,"A number of technologies enabled by Internet of Thing (IoT) have been used for the prevention of various chronic diseases, continuous and real-time tracking system is a particularly important one. Wearable medical devices with sensor, health cloud and mobile applications have continuously generating a huge amount of data which is often called as streaming big data. Due to the higher speed of the data generation, it is difficult to collect, process and analyze such massive data in real-time in order to perform real-time actions in case of emergencies and extracting hidden value. using traditional methods which are limited and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a significant need to real-time big data stream processing to ensure an effective and scalable solution. In order to overcome this issue, this work proposes a new architecture for real-time health status prediction and analytics system using big data technologies. The system focus on applying distributed machine learning model on streaming health data events ingested to Spark streaming through Kafka topics. Firstly, we transform the standard decision tree (DT) (C4.5) algorithm into a parallel, distributed, scalable and fast DT using Spark instead of Hadoop MapReduce which becomes limited for real-time computing. Secondly, this model is applied to streaming data coming from distributed sources of various diseases to predict health status. Based on several input attributes, the system predicts health status, send an alert message to care providers and store the details in a distributed database to perform health data analytics and stream reporting. We measure the performance of Spark DT against traditional machine learning tools including Weka. Finally, performance evaluation parameters such as throughput and execution time are calculated to show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The experimental results show that the proposed system is able to effectively process and predict real-time and massive amount of medical data enabled by IoT from distributed and various diseases. © 2019, The Author(s).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Ed-daoudy, A. and Maalmi, K.",2019,Journal of Big Data,10.1186/s40537-019-0271-7,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib

Luo2007497,Resource-adaptive real-time new event detection,"In a document streaming environment, online detection of the first documents that mention previously unseen events is an open challenge. For this online new event detection (ONED) task, existing studies usually assume that enough resources are always available and focus entirely on detection accuracy without considering efficiency. Moreover, none of the existing work addresses the issue of providing an effective and friendly user interface. As a result, there is a significant gap between the existing systems and a system that can be used in practice. In this paper, we propose an ONED framework with the following prominent features. First, a combination of indexing and compression methods is used to improve the document processing rate by orders of magnitude without sacrificing much detection accuracy. Second, when resources are tight, a resource-adaptive computation method is used to maximize the benefit that can be gained from the limited resources. Third, when the new event arrival rate is beyond the processing capability of the consumer of the ONED system, new events are further filtered and prioritized before they are presented to the consumer. Fourth, implicit citation relationships are created among all the documents and used to compute the importance of document sources. This importance information can guide the selection of document sources. We implemented a prototype of our framework on top of IBM's Stream Processing Core middleware. We also evaluated the effectiveness of our techniques on the standard TDT5 benchmark.

In this domain, ManArray-based processors use a single architecture definition, that supports multiple configurations of processing elements (PEs) from low end single PE to large arrays of PEs, and single tool set. The ManArray (selectable) parallelism architecture mixes control oriented operations, VLIWs, packed data operations, and distributed array processing in a cohesive, independently selectable manner.

Apache Storm has been of interest in both academia and industry because of its real-time, distributed, scalable and reliable framework for stream processing. In this paper, we propose an adaptive hierarchical scheduler for the Storm framework, to allocate the resources more efficiently and improve performance. In our method, we consider the data transfer rate and traffic pattern between Storm's tasks and assign highly-communicating task pairs to the same computing node by dynamically employing two phases of graph partitioning. We also calculate the number of required computing nodes in the cluster based on the overall load of the application and use this information to reduce inter-node traffic.

Cerviño2012295,Adaptive provisioning of stream processing systems in the cloud,"With the advent of data-intensive applications that generate large volumes of real-time data, distributed stream processing systems (DSPS) become increasingly important in domains such as social networking and web analytics. In practice, DSPSs must handle highly variable workloads caused by unpredictable changes in stream rates. Cloud computing offers an elastic infrastructure that DSPSs can use to obtain resources on-demand, but an open problem is to decide on the correct resource allocation when deploying DSPSs in the cloud. This paper proposes an adaptive approach for provisioning virtual machines (VMs) for the use of a DSPS in the cloud. We initially perform a set of benchmarks across performance metrics such as network latency and jitter to explore the feasibility of cloud-based DSPS deployments. Based on these results, we propose an algorithm for VM provisioning for DSPSs that reacts to changes in the stream workload.

However, it was demonstrated that malicious nodes could significantly reduce the network throughput by launching pollution attacks or entropy attacks. In this paper, we propose an efficient symmetric-key based authentication scheme for P2P live streaming system with network coding, to provide in-network detection against pollution attacks and entropy attacks simultaneously. Since the nature of P2P live streaming requires that the detection scheme has high computation efficiency and small communication overheads, we firstly propose a homomorphic message authentication code (MAC), called as PMAC, which has small key size and low computation overhead. Then, the proposed PMAC and the delayed key disclosure technique are employed to make sure that the peers could not only detect the corrupted blocks, but also upload blocks in accordance with random linear network coding.

While representing a paradigm shift in cloud computing, CaaaS poses several challenges in scalability, latency, time-window semantics, transaction control and result-set staging.A data stream is infinite thus can only be analyzed in granules. We propose a continuous query model over both static relations and dynamic streaming data, which allows a long-standing SQL query instance to run cycle by cycle, each cycle for a chunk of data from the data stream, using a cut-and-rewind mechanism. We further support the cycle-based transaction model with cycle-based isolation and visibility, for delivering analytics results to the clients continuously while the query is running. To have the continuously generated analytics results staged efficiently, we developed the table-ring and label switching mechanism characterized by staging data through metadata manipulation without physical data moving and copying. To scale-out analytics computation, we support both parallel database based and network distributed Map-Reduce based infrastructure with multiple cooperating engines.We have built the proposed infrastructure by extending the PostgreSQL engine.

Thomos2015893,Adaptive prioritized random linear coding and scheduling for layered data delivery from multiple servers,"In this paper, we deal with the problem of jointly determining the optimal coding strategy and the scheduling decisions when receivers obtain layered data from multiple servers. The layered data is encoded by means of prioritized random linear coding (PRLC) in order to be resilient to channel loss while respecting the unequal levels of importance in the data, and data blocks are transmitted simultaneously in order to reduce decoding delays and improve the delivery performance. We formulate the optimal coding and scheduling decisions problem in our novel framework with the help of Markov decision processes (MDP), which are effective tools for modeling adapting streaming systems. Reinforcement learning approaches are then proposed to derive reduced computational complexity solutions to the adaptive coding and scheduling problems. The novel reinforcement learning approaches and the MDP solution are examined in an illustrative example for scalable video transmission. Our methods offer large performance gains over competing methods that deliver the data blocks sequentially. The experimental evaluation also shows that our novel algorithms offer continuous playback and guarantee small quality variations which is not the case for baseline solutions.

Hazra2012,Power grid transient stability prediction using wide area synchrophasor measurements,"Electric power systems are prone to various kinds of transient disturbances which exist only for a fraction of second and often trigger cascading failures. Hence it is important to detect and prevent them from spreading in time. Conventionally these events are prevented by deploying costly special protection systems (SPS). Unfortunately, in many cases SPSs mis-operate as they could not predict the stability well ahead and are designed to operate based on past experiences and extensive off-line simulations. This paper proposes an online transient stability prediction scheme based on live synchrophasor data. The novelty of the proposed method is that it accurately predicts the transient stability based on only few (10 to 12) sample fault data without solving computationally extensive electromechanical dynamics. Synchrophasor data from geographically distributed Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are collected, synchronized, aggregated (if required) and analyzed on a stream computing platform to predict the trajectories of the generators which are then used to predict the transient stability of the grid. Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated on the benchmark systems and evaluation results are presented in this paper. © 2012 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Hazra, J. and Reddi, R.K. and Das, K. and Seetharam, D.P. and Sinha, A.K.",2012,IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe,10.1109/ISGTEurope.2012.6465752,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib

Experiments are run on two families of contour-based Fourier descriptors and two sets of region-based moments, all of them are invariant to translation, rotation and scale changes of hands. These methods are independent of the camera view point. Systematic tests are performed on the Triesch benchmark database and on our own large database, which includes more realistic conditions. Temporal filtering and a method for unknown posture detection are considered to improve posture recognition results in case of video stream processing. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Bourennane, S. and Fossati, C.",2012,"Signal, Image and Video Processing",10.1007/s11760-010-0176-6,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib
Carra20071667,Graph based analysis of mesh overlay streaming systems,"This paper studies fundamental properties of stream-based content distribution services. We assume the presence of an overlay network (such as those built by P2P systems) with limited degree of connectivity, and we develop a mathematical model that captures the essential features of overlay-based streaming protocols and systems. The methodology is based on stochastic graph theory, and models the streaming system as a stochastic process, whose characteristics are related to the streaming protocol. The model captures the elementary properties of the streaming system such as the number of active connections, the different play-out delay of nodes, and the probability of not receiving the stream due to node failures/misbehavior. Besides the static properties, the model is able to capture the transient behavior of the distribution graphs, i.e., the evolution of the structure over time, for instance in the initial phase of the distribution process. Contributions of this paper include a detailed definition of the methodology, its comparison with other analytical approaches and with simulative results, and a discussion of the additional insights enabled by this methodology. Results show that mesh based architectures are able to provide bounds on the receiving delay and maintain rate fluctuations due to system dynamics very low. Additionally, given the tight relationship between the stochastic process and the properties of the distribution protocol, this methodology gives basic guidelines for the design of such protocols and systems. © 2007 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Carra, D. and LoCigno, R. and Biersack, E.W.",2007,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,10.1109/JSAC.2007.071206,scopus-search1.bib
Riabov200631,Scalable planning for distributed stream processing systems,"Recently the problem of automatic composition of workflows has been receiving increasing interest. Initial investigation has shown that designing a practical and scalable composition algorithm for this problem is hard. A very general computational model of a workflow (e.g., BPEL) can be Turing-complete, which precludes fully automatic analysis of compositions. However, in many applications, workflow model can be simplified. We consider a model known as the Stream Processing Planning Language (SPPL), applicable in stream processing and other related domains. SPPL replaces the notion of concurrency by timeless functional computation. In addition, SPPL defines workflow metrics of resource consumption and quality of service. Experiments have shown earlier that even a naïve SPPL planning algorithm significantly outperforms existing metric PDDL planners on stream processing workflow composition problems. In this paper we describe an efficient and scalable algorithm for finding high-quality approximate solutions for large instances of SPPL problems. We demonstrate the scalability of the algorithm on synthetic benchmarks that are derived from practical problems. We also give an example of SPPL model for practical problems.

VanDongen20201845,Evaluation of Stream Processing Frameworks,"The increasing need for real-time insights in data sparked the development of multiple stream processing frameworks. Several benchmarking studies were conducted in an effort to form guidelines for identifying the most appropriate framework for a use case. In this article, we extend this research and present the results gathered. In addition to Spark Streaming and Flink, we also include the emerging frameworks Structured Streaming and Kafka Streams. We define four workloads with custom parameter tuning. Each of these is optimized for a certain metric or for measuring performance under specific scenarios such as bursty workloads. We analyze the relationship between latency, throughput, and resource consumption and we measure the performance impact of adding different common operations to the pipeline. To ensure correct latency measurements, we use a single Kafka broker. Our results show that the latency disadvantages of using a micro-batch system are most apparent for stateless operations. With more complex pipelines, customized implementations can give event-driven frameworks a large latency advantage. Due to its micro-batch architecture, Structured Streaming can handle very high throughput at the cost of high latency. Under tight latency SLAs, Flink sustains the highest throughput. Additionally, Flink shows the least performance degradation when confronted with periodic bursts of data. When a burst of data needs to be processed right after startup, however, micro-batch systems catch up faster while event-driven systems output the first events sooner. © 1990-2012 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,INCLUDED,INCLUDED,,,"VanDongen, G. and VanDenPoel, D.",2020,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,10.1109/TPDS.2020.2978480,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib
Gupta2018148,FogStore: A geo-distributed key-value store guaranteeing low latency for strongly consistent access,"We design Fogstore, a key-value store for event-based systems, that exploits the concept of relevance to guarantee low-latency access to relevant data with strong consistency guarantees, while providing tolerance from geographically correlated failures. Distributed event-based processing pipelines are envisioned to utilize the resources of densely geo-distributed infrastructures for low-latency responses - enabling real-time applications. Increasing complexity of such applications results in higher dependence on state, which has driven the incorporation of state-management as a core functionality of contemporary stream processing engines a la Apache Flink and Samza. Processing components executing under the same context (like location) often produce information that may be relevant to others, thereby necessitating shared state and an out-of-band globally-accessible data-store. Efficient access to application state is critical for overall performance, thus centralized data-stores are not a viable option due to the high-latency of network traversals. On the other hand, a highly geo-distributed datastore with low-latency implemented with current key-value stores would necessitate degrading client expectation of consistency as per the PACELC theorem. In this paper we exploit the notion of contextual relevance of events (data) in situation-awareness applications - and offer differential consistency guarantees for clients based on their context. We highlight important systems concerns that may arise with a highly geo-distributed system and show how Fogstore's design tackles them. We present, in detail, a prototype implementation of Fogstore's mechanisms on Apache Cassandra and a performance evaluation. Our evaluations show that Fogstore is able to achieve the throughput of eventually consistent configurations while serving data with strong consistency to the contextually relevant clients. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Gupta, H. and Ramachandran, U.",2018,DEBS 2018 - Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-Based Systems,10.1145/3210284.3210297,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;acm2-search1.bib
Zhang2017659,Revisiting the design of data stream processing systems on multi-core processors,"Driven by the rapidly increasing demand for handling real-Time data streams, many data stream processing (DSP) systems have been proposed. Regardless of the different architectures of those DSP systems, they are mostly aiming at scaling out using a cluster of commodity machines and built around a number of key design aspects: A) pipelined processing with message passing, b) on-demand data parallelism, and c) JVM based implementation. However, there lacks a study on those key design aspects on modern scale-up architectures, where more CPU cores are being put on the same die, and the onchip cache hierarchies are getting larger, deeper, and complex. Multiple sockets bring non-uniform memory access (NUMA) effort. In this paper, we revisit the aforementioned design aspects on a modern scale-up server. Specifically, we use a series of applications as micro benchmark to conduct detailed profiling studies on Apache Storm and Flink. From the profiling results, we observe two major performance issues: A) the massively parallel execution model causes serious front-end stalls, which are a major performance bottleneck issue on a single CPU socket, b) the lack of NUMA-Aware mechanism causes major drawback on the scalability of DSP systems on multi-socket architectures. Addressing these issues should allow DSP systems to exploit modern scale-up architectures, which also benefits scaling out environments. We present our initial efforts on resolving the above-mentioned performance issues, which have shown up to 3.2x and 3.1x improvement on the performance of Storm and Flink, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,INCLUDED,INCLUDED,,,"Zhang, S. and He, B. and Dahlmeier, D. and Zhou, A.C. and Heinze, T.",2017,Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering,10.1109/ICDE.2017.119,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib;scholar.bib
Tang20132344,Autopipelining for data stream processing,"Stream processing applications use online analytics to ingest high-rate data sources, process them on-the-fly, and generate live results in a timely manner. The data flow graph representation of these applications facilitates the specification of stream computing tasks with ease, and also lends itself to possible runtime exploitation of parallelization on multicore processors. While the data flow graphs naturally contain a rich set of parallelization opportunities, exploiting them is challenging due to the combinatorial number of possible configurations. Furthermore, the best configuration is dynamic in nature; it can differ across multiple runs of the application, and even during different phases of the same run. In this paper, we propose an autopipelining solution that can take advantage of multicore processors to improve throughput of streaming applications, in an effective and transparent way. The solution is effective in the sense that it provides good utilization of resources by dynamically finding and exploiting sources of pipeline parallelism in streaming applications. It is transparent in the sense that it does not require any hints from the application developers. As a part of our solution, we describe a light-weight runtime profiling scheme to learn resource usage of operators comprising the application, an optimization algorithm to locate best places in the data flow graph to explore additional parallelism, and an adaptive control scheme to find the right level of parallelism. We have implemented our solution in an industrial-strength stream processing system.

Jonathan2018412,Multi-query optimization in wide-area streaming analytics,"Wide-area data analytics has gained much attention in recent years due to the increasing need for analyzing data that are geographically distributed. Many of such queries often require real-time analysis on data streams that are continuously being generated across multiple locations. Yet, analyzing these geo-distributed data streams in a timely manner is very challenging due to the highly heterogeneous and limited bandwidth availability of the wide-area network (WAN). This paper examines the opportunity of applying multi-query optimization in the context of wide-area streaming analytics, with the goal of utilizing WAN bandwidth efficiently while achieving high throughput and low latency execution. Our approach is based on the insight that many streaming analytics queries often exhibit common executions, whether in consuming a common set of input data or performing the same data processing. In this work, we study different types of sharing opportunities and propose a practical online algorithm that allows streaming analytics queries to share their common executions incrementally. We further address the importance of WAN awareness in applying multi-query optimization. Without WAN awareness, sharing executions in a wide-area environment may lead to performance degradation. We have implemented our WAN-aware multi-query optimization in a prototype implementation based on Apache Flink. Experimental evaluation using Twitter traces on a real wide-area system deployment across geo-distributed EC2 data centers shows that our technique is able to achieve 21% higher throughput while saving WAN bandwidth consumption by 33% compared to a WAN-aware, sharing-agnostic system. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Jonathan, A. and Chandra, A. and Weissman, J.",2018,SoCC 2018 - Proceedings of the 2018 ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,10.1145/3267809.3267842,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;acm2-search1.bib
Zacheilas2017112,Maximizing determinism in stream processing under latency constraints,"The problem of coping with the demands of determinism and meeting latency constraints is challenging in distributed data stream processing systems that have to process high volume data streams that arrive from different unsynchronized input sources. In order to deterministically process the streaming data, they need mechanisms that synchronize the order in which tuples are processed by the operators. On the other hand, achieving real-time response in such a system requires careful tradeoff between determinism and low latency performance. We build on a recently proposed approach to handle data exchange and synchronization in stream processing, namely ScaleGate, which comes with guarantees for determinism and an efficient lock-free implementation, enabling high scalability. Considering the challenge and trade-offs implied by real-time constraints, we propose a system which comprises (a) a novel data structure called Slack-ScaleGate (SSG), along with its algorithmic implementation; SSG enables us to guarantee the deterministic processing of tuples as long as they are able to meet their latency constraints, and (b) a method to dynamically tune the maximum amount of time that a tuple can wait in the SSG data-structure, relaxing the determinism guarantees when needed, in order to satisfy the latency constraints.

Liu2013351,Peer-assisted on-demand streaming: Characterizing demands and optimizing supplies,"Nowadays, there has been significant deployment of peer-assisted on-demand streaming services over the Internet. Two of the most unique and salient features in a peer-assisted on-demand streaming system are the differentiation in the demand (or request) and the prefetching capability with caching. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework based on queuing models, in order to 1) justify the superiority of service prioritization based on a taxonomy of requests, and 2) understand the fundamental principles behind optimal prefetching and caching designs in peer-assisted on-demand streaming systems. The focus is to instruct how limited uploading bandwidth resources and peer caching capacities can be utilized most efficiently to achieve better system performance. To achieve these objectives, we first use priority queuing analysis to prove how service quality and user experience can be statistically guaranteed, by prioritizing requests in the order of significance, including urgent playback (e.g., random seeks or initial startup), normal playback, and prefetching. We then proceed to construct a fine-grained stochastic supply-demand model to investigate peer caching and prefetching as a global optimization problem. This not only provides insights in understanding the fundamental characterization of demand, but also offers guidelines toward optimal prefetching and caching strategies in peer-assisted on-demand streaming systems. © 1968-2012 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Liu, F. and Li, B. and Li, B. and Jin, H.",2013,IEEE Transactions on Computers,10.1109/TC.2011.222,scopus-search1.bib
Nguyen2011,PAL: Propagation-aware Anomaly Localization for cloud hosted distributed applications,"Distributed applications running inside cloud are prone to performance anomalies due to various reasons such as insufficient resource allocations, unexpected workload increases, or software bugs. However, those applications often consist of multiple interacting components where one component anomaly may cause its dependent components to exhibit anomalous behavior as well. It is challenging to identify the faulty components among numerous distributed application components. In this paper, we present a Propagation-aware Anomaly Localization (PAL) system that can pinpoint the source faulty components in distributed applications by extracting anomaly propagation patterns. PAL provides a robust critical change point discovery algorithm to accurately capture the onset of anomaly symptoms at different application components. We then derive the propagation pattern by sorting all critical change points in chronological order. PAL is completely application-agnostic and non-intrusive, which only relies on system-level metrics. We have implemented PAL on top of the Xen platform and tested it on a production cloud computing infrastructure using the RUBiS online auction benchmark application and the IBM System S data streaming processing application with a range of common software bugs. Our experimental results show that PAL can pinpoint faulty components in distributed applications with high accuracy and low overhead. © 2011 ACM.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Nguyen, H. and Tan, Y. and Gu, X.",2011,"Managing Large-Scale Systems via the Analysis of System Logs and the Application of Machine Learning Techniques, SLAML'11",10.1145/2038633.2038634,scopus-search1.bib;acm3-search1.bib

Tudoran201423,JetStream: Enabling high performance event streaming across cloud data-centers,"The easily-accessible computation power offered by cloud infrastructures coupled with the revolution of Big Data are expanding the scale and speed at which data analysis is performed. In their quest for finding the Value in the 3 Vs of Big Data, applications process larger data sets, within and across clouds. Enabling fast data transfers across geographically distributed sites becomes particularly important for applications which manage continuous streams of events in real time. Scientific applications (e.g. the Ocean Observatory Initiative or the ATLAS experiment) as well as commercial ones (e.g. Microsoft's Bing and Office 365 large-scale services) operate on tens of data-centers around the globe and follow similar patterns: they aggregate monitoring data, assess the QoS or run global data mining queries based on inter site event stream processing. In this paper, we propose a set of strategies for efficient transfers of events between cloud data-centers and we introduce JetStream: a prototype implementing these strategies as a high performance batch-based streaming middleware. JetStream is able to self-adapt to the streaming conditions by modeling and monitoring a set of context parameters. It further aggregates the available bandwidth by enabling multi-route streaming across cloud sites. The prototype was validated on tens of nodes from US and Europe data-centers of the Windows Azure cloud using synthetic benchmarks and with application code from the context of the Alice experiment at CERN. The results show an increase in transfer rate of 250 times over individual event streaming. Besides, introducing an adaptive transfer strategy brings an additional 25% gain.

Fang2007232,Active memory operations,"The performance of modern microprocessors is increasingly limited by their inability to hide main memory latency. The problem is worse in large-scale shared memory systems, where remote memory latencies are hundreds, and soon thousands, of processor cycles. To mitigate this problem, we propose the use of Active Memory Operations (AMOs), in which select operations can be sent to and executed on the home memory controller of data. AMOs can eliminate significant number of coherence messages, minimize intranode and internode memory traffic, and create opportunities for parallelism. Our implementation of AMOs is cache-coherent and requires no changes to the processor core or DRAM chips. In this paper we present architectural and programming models for AMOs, and compare its performance to that of several other memory architectures on a variety of scientific and commercial benchmarks. Through simulation we show that AMOs offer dramatic performance improvements for an important set of data-intensive operations, e.g., up to 50X faster barriers, 12X faster spinlocks, 8.5X-15X faster stream/array operations, and 3X faster database queries. Based on a standard cell implementation, we predict that the circuitry required to support AMOs is less than 1% of the typical chip area of a high performance microprocessor.

Wireless video streaming applications are characterized by their bandwidth-intensity, delay-sensitivity, and loss-tolerance. Our main contributions include i) a rate-minimized unequal erasure protection (UXP) scheme, ii) an analytical expression for packet delay and play-out deadline of UXP protected scalable video, iii) a loss-distortion model for hierarchical predictive video coders with picture copy concealment, iv) an analysis of the performance and complexity of delay-aware, capacity-aware, and optimized UXP streaming scenarios, and v) we show that the use of unequal error protection causes a rate-constrained optimization problem to be nonconvex.

Ferdman2007105,Last-touch correlated data streaming,"Recent research advocates address-correlating predictors to identify cache block addresses for prefetch. Unfortunately, address-correlating predictors require correlation data storage proportional in size to a program's active memory footprint. As a result, current proposals for this class of predictor are either limited in coverage due to constrained on-chip storage requirements or limited in prediction lookaheaddue to long off-chip correlation data lookup. In this paper, we propose Last-Touch Correlated Data Streaming (LT-cords), a practical address-correlating predictor. The key idea of LT-cords is to record correlation data off chip in the order they will be used and stream them into a practicallysized on-chip table shortly before they are needed, thereby obviating the need for scalable on-chip tables and enabling low-latency lookup. We use cycle-accurate simulation of an 8-way out-of-order superscalar processor to show that: (1) LT-cords with 214KB of on-chip storage can achieve the same coverage as a last-touch predictor with unlimited storage, without sacrificing predictor lookahead, and (2) LT-cords improves performance by 60% on average and 385% at best in the benchmarks studied. © 2007 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Ferdman, M. and Falsafi, B.",2007,ISPASS 2007: IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software,10.1109/ISPASS.2007.363741,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib

In this paper, we introduce a general purpose storage management framework for DSMSs that performs these tasks based on a clean, loosely-coupled, and flexible system design that also facilitates performance optimization. An important contribution of the framework is that, in analogy to buffer management techniques in relational database systems, it uses information about the access patterns of streaming applications to tune and customize the performance of the storage manager. In the paper, we first analyze typical application requirements at different granularities in order to identify important tunable parameters and their corresponding values. Based on these parameters, we define a general-purpose storage management interface. Using the interface, a developer can use our SMS (Storage Manager for Streams) to generate a customized storage manager for streaming applications. We explore the performance and potential of SMS through a set of experiments using the Linear Road benchmark.

Fernández-Rodríguez201762,Benchmarking real-time vehicle data streaming models for a smart city,"The information systems of smart cities offer project developers, institutions, industry and experts the possibility to handle massive incoming data from diverse information sources in order to produce new information services for citizens. Much of this information has to be processed as it arrives because a real-time response is often needed. Stream processing architectures solve this kind of problems, but sometimes it is not easy to benchmark the load capacity or the efficiency of a proposed architecture. This work presents a real case project in which an infrastructure was needed for gathering information from drivers in a big city, analyzing that information and sending real-time recommendations to improve driving efficiency and safety on roads. The challenge was to support the real-time recommendation service in a city with thousands of simultaneous drivers at the lowest possible cost. In addition, in order to estimate the ability of an infrastructure to handle load, a simulator that emulates the data produced by a given amount of simultaneous drivers was also developed. Experiments with the simulator show how recent stream processing platforms like Apache Kafka could replace custom-made streaming servers in a smart city to achieve a higher scalability and faster responses, together with cost reduction.

Bumgardner2014219,Scalable hybrid stream and hadoop network analysis system,"Collections of network traces have long been used in network traffic analysis. Flow analysis can be used in network anomaly discovery, intrusion detection and more generally, discovery of actionable events on the network. The data collected during processing may be also used for prediction and avoidance of traffic congestion, network capacity planning, and the development of software-defined networking rules. As network flow rates increase and new network technologies are introduced on existing hardware platforms, many organizations find themselves either technically or financially unable to generate, collect, and/or analyze network flow data. The continued rapid growth of network trace data, requires new methods of scalable data collection and analysis. We report on our deployment of a system designed and implemented at the University of Kentucky that supports analysis of network traffic across the enterprise. Our system addresses problems of scale in existing systems, by using distributed computing methodologies, and is based on a combination of stream and batch processing techniques. In addition to collection, stream processing using Storm is utilized to enrich the data stream with ephemeral environment data. Enriched stream-data is then used for event detection and near real-time flow analysis by an in-line complex event processor. Batch processing is performed by the Hadoop MapReduce framework, from data stored in HBase BigTable storage.

Stephen2016348,STYX: Stream processing with trustworthy cloud-based execution,"With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of devices are expected to continuously collect and process sensitive data (e.g., location, personal health). Due to limited computational capacity available on IoT devices, the current de facto model for building IoT applications is to send the gathered data to the cloud for computation. While private cloud infrastructures for handling large amounts of data streams are expensive to build, using low cost public (untrusted) cloud infrastructures for processing continuous queries including on sensitive data leads to concerns over data confidentiality. This paper presents STYX, a novel programming abstraction and managed runtime system, that ensures confidentiality of IoT applications whilst leveraging the public cloud for continuous query processing. The key idea is to intelligently utilize partially homomorphic encryption to perform as many computationally intensive operations as possible in the untrusted cloud. STYX provides a simple abstraction to the IoT developer to hide the complexities of (1) applying complex cryptographic primitives, (2) reasoning about performance of such primitives, (3) deciding which computations can be executed in an untrusted tier, and (4) optimizing cloud resource usage.

We propose a new visual and analytic environment to support debugging, performance analysis, and troubleshooting for stream processing applications. Our environment provides several visualization methods to study, characterize, and summarize the flow of tuples between stream processing operators.

Buddhika20161143,NEPTUNE: Real Time Stream Processing for Internet of Things and Sensing Environments,"Improvements in miniaturization and networking capabilities of sensors have contributed to the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and continuous sensing environments. Data streams generated in such settings must keep pace with generation rates and be processed in real time. Challenges in accomplishing this include: high data arrival rates, buffer overflows, context-switches, and object creation overheads. We propose a holistic framework that addresses the CPU, memory, network, and kernel issues involved in stream processing. Our prototype, Neptune, builds on our Granules cloud runtime. The framework maximizes bandwidth utilization in the presence of small messages via the use of buffering and dynamic compactions of packets based on payload entropy. Our use of thread-pools and batched processing reduces context switches and improves effective CPU utilizations. NEPTUNE alleviates memory pressure that can lead to swapping, page faults, and thrashing through efficient reuse of objects. To cope with buffer overflows we rely on flow control and throttling the preceding stages of a processing pipeline. Our benchmarks demonstrate the suitability of the Neptune and we contrast our performance with Apache Storm, the dominant stream-processing framework developed by Twitter.

One such extremely valuable insight is the discovery of correlations in real-time from large-scale time-series data. A key challenge in discovering correlations is that the number of time-series pairs that have to be analyzed grows quadratically in the number of time-series, giving rise to a quadratic increase in both computation cost and communication cost between the cluster nodes in a distributed environment. To tackle the challenge, we propose a framework called AEGIS.

Bellavista2014363,Priority-based resource scheduling in distributed stream processing systems for big data applications,"Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPSs) are attracting increasing industrial and academic interest as flexible tools to implement scalable and cost-effective on-line analytics applications over Big Data streams. Often hosted in private/public cloud deployment environments, DSPSs offer data stream processing services that transparently exploit the distributed computing resources made available to them at runtime. Given the volume of data of interest, possible (hard/soft) real-time processing requirements, and the time-variable characteristics of input data streams, it is very important for DSPSs to use smart and innovative scheduling techniques that allocate computing resources properly and avoid static over-provisioning. In this paper, we originally investigate the suitability of exploiting application-level indications about differentiated priorities of different stream processing tasks to enable application-specific DSPS resource scheduling, e.g., Capable of re-shaping processing resources in order to dynamically follow input data peaks of prioritized tasks, with no static over-provisioning. We originally propose a general and simple technique to design and implement priority-based resource scheduling in flow-graph-based DSPSs, by allowing application developers to augment DSPS graphs with priority metadata and by introducing an extensible set of priority schemas to be automatically handled by the extended DSPS.

Mahmood2018219,Adaptive processing of spatial-keyword data over a distributed streaming cluster,"The widespread use of GPS-enabled smartphones along with the popularity of micro-blogging and social networking applications, e.g., Twitter and Facebook, has resulted in the generation of huge streams of geo-tagged textual data. Many applications require real-time processing of these streams. For example, location-based ad-targeting systems enable advertisers to register millions of ads to millions of users based on the users’ location and textual proile. Existing streaming systems are either centralized or are not spatial-keyword aware, and hence these systems cannot eiciently support the processing of rapidly arriving spatial-keyword data streams. In this paper, we introduce a two-layered indexing scheme for the distributed processing of spatial-keyword data streams. We realize this indexing scheme in Tornado, a distributed spatial-keyword streaming system. The irst layer, termed the routing layer, is used to fairly distribute the workload, and furthermore, co-locate the data objects and the corresponding queries at the same processing units. The routing layer uses the Augmented-Grid, a novel structure that is equipped with an eicient search algorithm for distributing the data objects and queries. The second layer, termed the evaluation layer, resides within each processing unit to reduce the processing overhead. The two-layered index adapts to changes in the workload by applying a cost formula that continuously represents the processing overhead at each processing unit. Extensive experimental evaluation using real Twitter data indicates that Tornado achieves high scalability and more than 2x improvement over the baseline approach in terms of the overall system throughput. © 2018 held by the owner/author(s).

Imai2017504,Maximum Sustainable throughput Prediction for Data Stream Processing over Public Clouds,"In cloud-based stream processing services, the maximum sustainable throughput (MST) is defined as the maximum throughput that a system composed of a fixed number of virtual machines (VMs) can ingest indefinitely. If the incoming data rate exceeds the system's MST, unprocessed data accumulates, eventually making the system inoperable. Thus, it is important for the service provider to keep the MST always larger than the incoming data rate by dynamically changing the number of VMs used by the system. In this paper, we identify a common data processing environment used by modern data stream processing systems, and we propose MST prediction models for this environment. We train the models using linear regression with samples obtained from a few VMs and predict MST for a larger number of VMs. To minimize the time and cost for model training, we statistically determine a set of training samples using Intel's Storm benchmarks with representative resource usage patterns. Using typical use-case benchmarks on Amazon's EC2 public cloud, our experiments show that, training with up to 8 VMs, we can predict MST for streaming applications with less than 4% average prediction error for 12 VMs, 9% for 16 VMs, and 32% for 24 VMs. Further, we evaluate our prediction models with simulation based elastic VM scheduling on a realistic workload.

To achieve these objectives, we introduce a novel top-down data flow model for stream join processing (arguably, one of the most resource-intensive operators in stream processing), called SplitJoin, that operates by splitting the join operation into independent storing and processing steps that gracefully scale with respect to the number of cores. Furthermore, SplitJoin eliminates the need for global coordination while preserving the order of input streams by re-thinking how streams are channeled into distributed join computation cores and maintaining the order of output streams by proposing a novel distributed punctuation technique.

Dehghanzadeh2015307,Approximate continuous query answering over streams and dynamic linked data sets,"To perform complex tasks, RDF Stream Processing Web applications evaluate continuous queries over streams and quasi-static (background) data. While the former are pushed in the application, the latter are continuously retrieved from the sources. As soon as the background data increase the volume and become distributed over the Web, the cost to retrieve them increases and applications become unresponsive. In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing the evaluation of these queries by leveraging local views on background data. Local views enhance performance, but require maintenance processes, because changes in the background data sources are not automatically reflected in the application. We propose a two-step query-driven maintenance process to maintain the local view: it exploits information from the query (e.g., the sliding window definition and the current window content) to maintain the local view based on user-defined Quality of Service constraints.

Mokhtari2014819,BigKernel - High performance CPU-GPU communication pipelining for big data-style applications,"GPUs offer an order of magnitude higher compute power and memory bandwidth than CPUs. GPUs therefore might appear to be well suited to accelerate computations that operate on voluminous data sets in independent ways, e.g., for transformations, filtering, aggregation, partitioning or other 'Big Data' style processing. Yet experience indicates that it is difficult, and often error-prone, to write GPGPU programs which efficiently process data that does not fit in GPU memory, partly because of the intricacies of GPU hardware architecture and programming models, and partly because of the limited bandwidth available between GPUs and CPUs. In this paper, we propose Big Kernel, a scheme that provides pseudo-virtual memory to GPU applications and is implemented using a 4-stage pipeline with automated prefetching to (i) optimize CPU-GPU communication and (ii) optimize GPU memory accesses. Big Kernel simplifies the programming model by allowing programmers to write kernels using arbitrarily large data structures that can be partitioned into segments where each segment is operated on independently, these kernels are transformed into Big Kernel using straight-forward compiler transformations. Our evaluation on six data-intensive benchmarks shows that Big Kernel achieves an average speedup of 1.7 over state-of-the-art double-buffering techniques and an average speedup of 3.0 over corresponding multi-threaded CPU implementations. © 2014 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Mokhtari, R. and Stumm, M.",2014,"Proceedings of the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, IPDPS",10.1109/IPDPS.2014.89,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib
Hsu2010169,Quality-aware segment transmission scheduling in peer-to-peer streaming systems,"In peer-to-peer (P2P) mesh-based streaming systems, each video sequence is typically divided into segments, which are then streamed from multiple senders to a receiver. The receiver needs to coordinate the senders by specifying a transmission schedule for each of them. We consider the scheduling problem in both live and on-demand P2P streaming systems. We formulate the problem of scheduling segment transmission in order to maximize the perceived video quality of the receiver. We prove that this problem is NP-Complete. We present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for this problem, and we optimally solve it using an ILP solver. This optimal solution, however, is computationally expensive and is not suitable for real-time streaming systems. Thus, we propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm, which yields transmission schedules with analytical guarantees on the worst-case performance. More precisely, we show that the approximation factor is at most 3, compared to the absolutely optimal solution as a benchmark. We implement the proposed approximation and optimal algorithms in a packet-level simulator for P2P streaming systems. We also implement two other scheduling algorithms proposed in the literature and used in popular P2P streaming systems. By simulating large P2P systems and streaming nine real video sequences with diverse visual and motion characteristics, we demonstrate that our proposed approximation algorithm: (i) produces near-optimal perceived video quality, (ii) can run in real time, and (iii) outperforms other algorithms in terms of perceived video quality, smoothness of the rendered videos, and balancing the load across sending peers. For example, our simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms heuristic algorithms used in current systems by up to 8 dB in perceived video quality and up to 20% in continuity index.

The PLA vector comprises pairs of values (timestamp, trend) denoting the starting time of the trend and the type of the trend (either UP or DOWN) respectively. A distance metric for PLA vectors is introduced. We propose split and merge criteria to continuously update the clustering information. Moreover, the proposed method handles outliers.

Liu2008568,Performance analysis and industrial practice of peer-assisted content distribution network for large-scale live video streaming,"Recently efficient and scalable live video streaming system over the Internet has become a hot topic. In order to improve the system performance metrics, such as startup delay, source-to-end delay, playback continuity and scalability, many previous works developed two successful cases of Content Distribution Network (CDN) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network for the design of large-scale live video streaming systems, but no single one has yet delivered both the scale and service quality. To combine the advantages of CDN and P2P network has been considered as a feasible orientation for large-scale video stream delivering. In this paper, we propose a peer-assisted content distribution network, i.e. PACDN, which borrows the mesh-based P2P ideas into the traditional CDN to enhance the performance and scalability. The basic features of PACDN include: 1) To meet the real time requirement of live video stream service, i.e. to ensure that the video stream could be continuously and stably delivered from the source to each edge server for offering good QoS to different regions clients, the placement edge servers and source streaming server(s) build a hierarchical multi-tree based and in-hierarchy peer-assisted overlay, which is optimized according to the knowledge of underlying physical topology. This scheme in the design is called ""server side peer-assisted"". 2) To enhance the system scalability and reduce the deployment cost, clients and edge servers construct a Client/Server based and P2P network assisted overlay with the increasing of viewers, which is called ""client side peer-assisted"" in this design. We compare the inner performance of PACDN with existing approaches based on comprehensive simulations and analysis. The results show that our proposed design outperforms previous systems in the service quality and scalability. PACDN has been implemented as an Internet live video streaming service and it was successfully deployed for broadcasting many important live programs in China in 2007. The industrial experiences prove that this design is scalable and reliable. We believe that the wide deployment of PACDN and its further development will soon benefit many more Internet users. © 2008 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Liu, X. and Yin, H. and Lin, C. and Liu, Y. and Chen, Z. and Xiao, X.",2008,"Proceedings - International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications, AINA",10.1109/AINA.2008.132,scopus-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib;scholar.bib
Liang2007472,Self-configuring information management for large-scale service overlays,"Service overlay networks (SON) provide important infrastructure support for many emerging distributed applications such as web service composition, distributed stream processing, and workflow management. Quality-sensitive distributed applications such as multimedia services and on-line data analysis often desire the SON to provide up-to-date dynamic information about different overlay nodes and overlay links. However, it is a challenging task to provide scalable and efficient information management for large-scale SONs, where both system conditions and application requirements can change over time. In this paper, we present InfoEye, a model-based self-configuring distributed information management system that consists of a set of monitoring sensors deployed on different overlay nodes. InfoEye can dynamically configure the operations of different sensors based on current statistical application query patterns and system attribute distributions. Thus, InfoEye can greatly improve the scalability of SON by answering information queries with minimum monitoring overhead. We have implemented a prototype of InfoEye and evaluated its performance using both extensive simulations and micro-benchmark experiments on PlanetLab. The experimental results show that InfoEye can significantly reduce the information management overhead compared with existing approaches. In addition, InfoEye can quickly reconfigure itself in response to application requirement and system information pattern changes. © 2007 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Liang, J. and Gut, X. and Nahrstedt, K.",2007,Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM,10.1109/INFCOM.2007.62,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib

The system is operated by two remote entities, where one entity - for instance an autonomous aerial vehicle - captures and reconstructs the environment as well as transmits the data to another entity - such as human observer - that can immersivly explore the 3D scene, decoupled from the view of the capturing entity. The performance evaluation revealed the framework's capabilities to perform RGB-D data capturing, dense 3D reconstruction, streaming and dynamic scene updating in real time for indoor environments up to a size of 100m2, using either a state-of-the-art mobile computer or a workstation.

HoseinyFarahabady2016334,A QoS-aware controller for Apache Storm,"Apache Storm has recently emerged as an attractive fault-tolerant open-source distributed data processing platform that has been chosen by many industry leaders to develop real-time applications for processing a huge amount of data in a scalable manner. A key aspect to achieve the best performance in this system lies on the design of an efficient scheduler for component execution, called topology, on the available computing resources. In response to workload fluctuations, we propose an advanced scheduler for Apache Storm that provides improved performance with highly dynamic behavior. While enforcing the required Quality-of-Service (QoS) of individual data streams, the controller allocates computing resources based on decisions that consider the future states of non-controllable disturbance parameters, e.g. arriving rate of tuples or resource utilization in each worker node. The performance evaluation is carried out by comparing the proposed solution with two well-known alternatives, namely the Storm's default scheduler and the best-effort approach (i.e. the heuristic that is based on the first-fit decreasing approximation algorithm). Experimental results clearly show that the proposed controller increases the overall resource utilization by 31% on average compared to the two others solutions, without significant negative impact on the QoS enforcement level. © 2016 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"HoseinyFarahabady, M.R. and DehghaniSamani, H.R. and Wang, Y. and Zomaya, A.Y. and Tari, Z.",2016,"Proceedings - 2016 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications, NCA 2016",10.1109/NCA.2016.7778638,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib

Most of the prior arts target relatively static graphs and also process them in store-and-process batch processing model. In this paper we propose a method of applying on-the-fly and incremental graph stream computing model to such dynamic graph analysis. To process large-scale graph streams on a cluster of nodes dynamically in a scalable fashion, we propose an incremental large-scale graph processing model called ""Incremental GIM-V (Generalized Iterative Matrix-Vector Multiplication)"".

Concurrently, IT community focuses on scaling the analysis of big-data over a cluster of nodes. So far, combinations of these approaches have targeted flexibility and usability over real-timeliness of results and efficient allocation of resources. In this paper we show how to meet both objectives with BlockMon, a network monitoring platform originally designed to work on a single node, which we extended to run distributed stream-data analytics tasks. We compare its performance against Storm and Apache S4, the state-ofthe-art open-source stream-processing platforms, by implementing a phone call anomaly detection system and a Twitter trending algorithm: our enhanced BlockMon has a gain in performance of over 2.5x and 23x, respectively.

Chen2011,Modeling and performance analysis of P2P live streaming systems under flash crowds,"A fundamental problem that a peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming system faces is how to support flash crowds effectively. A flash crowd occurs when a burst of join requests arrive at a system. When a flash crowd occurs, the sudden arrival of numerous peers may starve the upload capacity of a P2P system, and degrade the quality of service. By theoretical analysis and simulations, we find that a system has limited capacity to handle a flash crowd: It can recover to a new stable state when the size of flash crowd is small or moderate, but collapse when the flash crowd is excessively large. The capacity of a system is independent of initial state of the system while relevant to stable peers' departure rate, which suggests this capacity is an essential property of a P2P live streaming system. In addition, we prove that a P2P live streaming system with admission control has excellent capacity to handle flash crowds: It can recover from flash crowds of excessively large size and a startup peer's waiting time scales logarithmically with the size of flash crowds. Our theoretical model and simulation results provide a promising framework to understand the capacity of a P2P live streaming system for handling flash crowds. © 2011 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Chen, Y. and Zhang, B. and Chen, C.",2011,IEEE International Conference on Communications,10.1109/icc.2011.5962881,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib
Brito200922,Multithreading-enabled active replication for event stream processing operators,"Event Stream Processing (ESP) systems are very popular in monitoring applications. Algorithmic trading, network monitoring and sensor networks are good examples of applications that rely upon ESP systems. As these systems become larger and more widely deployed, they have to answer increasingly stronger requirements that are often difficult to satisfy. Fault-tolerance is a good example of such a nontrivial requirement. Making ESP operators fault-tolerant can add considerable performance overhead to the application. In this paper, we focus on active replication as an approach to provide fault-tolerance to ESP operators. More precisely, we address the performance costs of active replication for operators in distributed ESP applications. We use a speculation mechanism based on Software Transactional Memory (STM) to achieve the following goals: (i) enable replicas to make progress using optimistic delivery; (ii) enable early forwarding of speculative computation results; (iii) enable active replication of multi-threaded operators using transactional executions. Experimental evaluation shows that, using this combination of mechanisms, one can implement highly efficient fault-tolerant ESP operators. © 2009 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Brito, A. and Fetzer, C. and Felber, P.",2009,Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems,10.1109/SRDS.2009.37,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee1-search1.bib
Bracciale20081,A push-based scheduling algorithm for large scale P2P live streaming,"In this paper, we present a chunk scheduling algorithm for a mesh-based peer-to-peer live streaming system and we evaluate it by simulations over large-scale networks. Literature papers typically design chunk scheduling algorithms by considering the chunk delivery ratio as performance metric. We propose a push-based algorithm, which not only tries to maximize the chunk delivery ratio but it also takes into account and tries to minimize the delivery delay of chunks at the peer nodes. This is an important requirement, when dealing with real-time multimedia flows. Another important contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of a simulator able to evaluate the performance of large scale P2P networks (tens of thousands peers). The importance of this contribution lies in the fact that existing simulators and performance studies handle at most hundreds or few thousands of peers, while real-life P2P streaming systems aim at distributing contents to several hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of users. The performance evaluation study aims at providing a comprehensive view of what performance can be expected for mesh-based peer-to-peer streaming systems, both in terms of chunk delivery ratio and delay, for a large range of the number of users. The individual effect of a variety of system parameters, and especially number of partner nodes in the mesh, constrained link bandwidth, node heterogeneity, and network size, has been analyzed. Our results show that performances of the proposed push-based solution are already quite effective even with severely bandwidth constrained large scale networks. © 2008 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Bracciale, L. and LoPiccolo, F. and Luzzi, D. and Salsano, S. and Bianchi, G. and Blefari-Melazzi, N.",2008,"Proceedings of the 2008 4th International Telecommunication Networking Workshop on QoS in Multiservice IP Networks, IT-NEWS",10.1109/ITNEWS.2008.4488121,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib
Walulya2018297,Viper: A module for communication-layer determinism and scaling in low-latency stream processing,"Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) process continuous streams of data and produce results in a real-time fashion, typically through one-at-a-time tuple analysis. In Fog architectures, the limited resources of the edge devices, enabling close-to-the-source scalable analysis, demand for computationally- and energy-efficient SPEs. When looking into the vital SPE processing properties required from applications, determinism, which ensures consistent results independently of the way the analysis is parallelized, has a strong position besides scalability in throughput and low processing latency. SPEs scale in throughput and latency by relying on shared-nothing parallelism, deploying multiple copies of each operator to which tuples are distributed based on its semantics. The coordination of the asynchronous analysis of parallel operators required to enforce determinism is then carried out by additional dedicated sorting operators. To prevent this costly coordination from becoming a bottleneck, we introduce the Viper communication module, which can be integrated in the SPE communication layer and boost the coordination of the parallel threads analyzing the data. Using Apache Storm and data extracted from the Linear Road benchmark and a real-world smart grid system, we show benefits in the throughput, latency and energy efficiency coming from the utilization of the Viper module.

Nagasu2017153,"FPGA-based tsunami simulation: Performance comparison with GPUs, and roofline model for scalability analysis","MOST (Method Of Splitting Tsunami) is widely used to solve shallow water equations (SWEs) for simulation of tsunami. This paper presents high-performance and power-efficient computation of MOST for practical tsunami simulation with FPGA. The custom hardware for simulation is based on a stream computing architecture for deeply pipelining to increase performance with a limited bandwidth. We design a stream processing element (SPE) of computing kernels combined with stencil buffers. We also introduce an SPE array architecture with spatial and temporal parallelism to further exploit available hardware resources by implementing multiple SPEs with parallel internal pipelines. Our prototype implementation with Arria 10 FPGA demonstrates that the FPGA-based design performs numerically stable tsunami simulation with real ocean-depth data in single precision by introducing non-dimensionalization. We explore the design space of SPE arrays, and find that the design of six cascaded SPEs with a single pipeline achieves the sustained performance of 383 GFlops and the performance per power of 8.41 GFlops/W with a stream bandwidth of only 7.2 GB/s. These numbers are 8.6 and 17.2 times higher than those of NVidia Tesla K20c GPU, and 1.7 and 7.1 times higher than those of AMD Radeon R9 280X GPU, respectively, for the same tsunami simulation in single precision. Moreover, we proposed a roofline model for stream computing with the SPE array in order to investigate factors of performance degradation and possible performance improvement for given FPGAs. With the model, we estimate that an upcoming Stratix 10 GX2800 FPGA can achieve the sustained performance of 8.7.TFlops at most with our SPE array architecture for tsunami simulation.

Mortazavi-Dehkordi2020241,Efficient deadline-aware scheduling for the analysis of Big Data streams in public Cloud,"The emergence of Big Data has had a profound impact on how data are analyzed. Open source distributed stream processing platforms have gained popularity for analyzing streaming Big Data as they provide low latency required for streaming Big Data applications using Cloud resources. However, existing resource schedulers are still lacking the efficiency and deadline meeting that Big Data analytical applications require. Recent works have already considered streaming Big Data characteristics to improve the efficiency and the likelihood of deadline meeting for scheduling in the platforms. Nevertheless, they have not taken into account the specific attributes of analytical application, public Cloud utilization cost and delays caused by performance degradation of leasing public Cloud resources. This study, therefore, presents BCframework, an efficient deadline-aware scheduling framework used by streaming Big Data analysis applications based on public Cloud resources. BCframework proposes a scheduling model which considers public Cloud utilization cost, performance variation, deadline meeting and latency reduction requirements of streaming Big Data analytical applications. Furthermore, it introduces two operator scheduling algorithms based on both a novel partitioning algorithm and an operator replication method. BCframework is highly adaptable to the fluctuation of streaming Big Data and the performance degradation of public Cloud resources.

Gao2019376,Multi-User Cooperative Mobile Video Streaming: Performance Analysis and Online Mechanism Design,"Adaptive bitrate streaming enables video users to adapt their playing bitrates to the real-time network conditions, hence achieving the desirable quality-of-experience (QoE). In a multi-user wireless scenario, however, existing single-user based bitrate adaptation methods may fail to provide the desirable QoE, due to lack of consideration of multi-user interactions (such as the multi-user interferences and network congestion). In this work, we propose a novel user cooperation framework based on user-provided networking for multi-user mobile video streaming over wireless cellular networks. The framework enables nearby mobile video users to crowdsource their cellular links and resources for cooperative video streaming. We first analyze the social welfare performance bound of the proposed cooperative streaming system by introducing a virtual time-slotted system. Then, we design a low complexity Lyapunov-based online algorithm, which can be implemented in an online and distributed manner without the complete future and global network information. Numerical results show that the proposed online algorithm achieves an average 97 percent of the theoretical maximum social welfare. We further conduct experiments with real data traces, to compare our proposed online algorithm with the existing online algorithms in the literature.

GhaffariSheshjavani20177535,An adaptive buffer-map exchange mechanism for pull-based peer-to-peer video-on-demand streaming systems,"Unlike P2P live video streaming in which all the peers in a channel watch a video with tiny differences in viewing points, in P2P video on demand (VoD) streaming systems, neighbor peers may watch the same video with more different viewing points; therefore, using push-based approach is not efficient for such systems, and the overhead of the pull-based approaches is challenging due to the periodical exchange of buffer-maps among the peers. In pull-based P2P VoD systems, to achieve better quality of experience it is necessary to use large buffers at the peers that results in more buffer-maps exchange overhead. In this paper, we study buffer-map exchange challenging in pull-based P2P VoD streaming systems and propose an adaptive mechanism for decreasing overhead by sending the buffer-maps with regard to the viewing points of the peers.

By using this effective mechanism, better quality of service can be achieved through using large buffers at the peers, without increasing in the overhead.

Distributed stream processing systems offer a scalable and efficient means of in-network processing of such data streams.

Our contribution includes a transformation algorithm which takes as input a high-level program and gives as output the structure of an optimized pipeline ring. Our technique handles nested loops and is further enhanced by loop unrolling.

Enzler200563,System-level performance evaluation of reconfigurable processors,"Reconfigurable architectures that tightly integrate a standard CPU core with a field-programmable hardware structure have recently been receiving increased attention. The design of such a hybrid reconfigurable processor involves a multitude of design decisions regarding the field-programmable structure as well as its system integration with the CPU core. Determining the impact of these design decisions on the overall system performance is a challenging task. In this paper, we first present a framework for the cycle-accurate performance evaluation of hybrid reconfigurable processors on the system level. Then, we discuss a reconfigurable processor for data-streaming applications, which attaches a coarse-grained reconfigurable unit to the coprocessor interface of a standard embedded CPU core. By means of a case study we evaluate the system-level impact of certain design features for the reconfigurable unit, such as multiple contexts, register replication, and hardware context scheduling. The results illustrate that a system-level evaluation framework is of paramount importance for studying the architectural trade-offs and optimizing design parameters for reconfigurable processors. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract The dynamic progress in the nature of pervasive computing datasets has been main motivation for development of the NoSQL model. The devices having capability of executing “Internet of Things” (IoT) concepts are producing massive amount of data in various forms (structured and unstructured). To handle this IoT data with traditional database schemes is impracticable and expensive. The large-scale unstructured data required as the prerequisites for a preparing pipeline, which flawlessly consolidating the NoSQL storage model such as Apache Cassandra and a Big Data processing platform such as Apache Spark. The Apache Spark is the data-intensive computing paradigm, which allows users to write the applications in various high-level programming languages including Java, Scala, R, Python, etc. The Spark Streaming module receives live input data streams and divides that data into batches by using the Map and Reduce operations. This research presents a novel and scalable approaches called ""Smart Cassandra Spark Integration (SCSI)” for solving the challenge of integrating NoSQL data stores like Apache Cassandra with Apache Spark to manage distributed systems based on varied platter of amalgamation of current technologies, IT enabled devices, etc., while eliminating complexity and risk.

Hoffmann201895,Snailtrail: Generalizing critical paths for online analysis of distributed dataflows,"We rigorously generalize critical path analysis (CPA) to long-running and streaming computations and present SnailTrail, a system built on Timely Dataflow, which applies our analysis to a range of popular distributed dataflow engines. Our technique uses the novel metric of critical participation, computed on time-based snapshots of execution traces, that provides immediate insights into specific parts of the computation. This allows SnailTrail to work online in real-time, rather than requiring complete offline traces as with traditional CPA. It is thus applicable to scenarios like model training in machine learning, and sensor stream processing. SnailTrail assumes only a highly general model of dataflow computation (which we define) and we show it can be applied to systems as diverse as Spark, Flink, TensorFlow, and Timely Dataflow itself. We further show with examples from all four of these systems that SnailTrail is fast and scalable, and that critical participation can deliver performance analysis and insights not available using prior techniques. © Proceedings of NSDI 2010: 7th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation.

Runsewe2017848,Cloud Resource Scaling for Big Data Streaming Applications Using a Layered Multi-dimensional Hidden Markov Model,"Recent advancements in technology have led to a deluge of data that require real-Time analysis with strict latency constraints. A major challenge, however, is determining the amount of resources required by big data stream processing applications in response to heterogeneous data sources, streaming events, unpredictable data volume and velocity changes. Over-provisioning of resources for peak loads can be wasteful while under-provisioning can have a huge impact on the performance of the streaming applications. The majority of research efforts on resource scaling in the cloud are investigated from the cloud provider's perspective, they focus on web applications and do not consider multiple resource bottlenecks. We aim at analyzing the resource scaling problem from a big data streaming application provider's point of view such that efficient scaling decisions can be made for future resource utilization. This paper proposes a Layered Multi-dimensional Hidden Markov Model (LMD-HMM) for facilitating the management of resource auto-scaling for big data streaming applications in the cloud.

Kolchin2016280,YAbench: A comprehensive framework for RDF stream processor correctness and performance assessment,"RDF stream processing (RSP) has become a vibrant area of research in the semantic web community. Recent advances have resulted in the development of several RSP engines that leverage semantics to facilitate reasoning over flows of incoming data. These engines vary greatly in terms of implemented query syntax, their evaluation and operational semantics, and in various performance dimensions. Existing benchmarks tackle particular aspects such as functional coverage, result correctness, or performance. None of them, however, assess RSP engine behavior comprehensively with respect to all these dimensions. In this paper, we introduce YABench, a novel benchmarking framework for RSP engines. YABench extends the concept of correctness checking and provides a flexible and comprehensive tool set to analyze and evaluate RSP engine behavior. It is highly configurable and provides quantifiable and reproducible results on correctness and performance characteristics. To validate our approach, we replicate results of the existing CSRBench benchmark with YABench. We then assess two well-established RSP engines, CQELS and C-SPARQL, through more comprehensive experiments. In particular, we measure precision, recall, performance, and scalability characteristics while varying throughput and query complexity.

Zacheilas2016174,Dynamic load balancing techniques for distributed complex event processing systems,"Applying real-time, cost-effective Complex Event processing (CEP) in the cloud has been an important goal in recent years. Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS) have been widely adopted by major computing companies such as Facebook and Twitter for performing scalable event processing in streaming data. However, dynamically balancing the load of the DSPS’ components can be particularly challenging due to the high volume of data, the components’ state management needs, and the low latency processing requirements. Systems should be able to cope with these challenges and adapt to dynamic and unpredictable load changes in real-time. Our approach makes the following contributions: (i) we formulate the load balancing problem in distributed CEP systems as an instance of the job-shop scheduling problem, and (ii) we present a novel framework that dynamically balances the load of CEP engines in real-time and adapts to sudden changes in the volume of streaming data by exploiting two balancing policies.

Tudoran2016274,JetStream: Enabling high throughput live event streaming on multi-site clouds,"Scientific and commercial applications operate nowadays on tens of cloud datacenters around the globe, following similar patterns: they aggregate monitoring or sensor data, assess the QoS or run global data mining queries based on inter-site event stream processing. Enabling fast data transfers across geographically distributed sites allows such applications to manage the continuous streams of events in real time and quickly react to changes. However, traditional event processing engines often consider data resources as second-class citizens and support access to data only as a side-effect of computation (i.e. they are not concerned by the transfer of events from their source to the processing site): This is an efficient approach as long as the processing is executed in a single cluster where nodes are interconnected by low latency networks. In a distributed environment, consisting of multiple datacenters, with orders of magnitude differences in capabilities and connected by a WAN, this will undoubtedly lead to significant latency and performance variations. This is namely the challenge we address in this paper, by proposing JetStream, a high performance batch-based streaming middleware for efficient transfers of events between cloud datacenters. JetStream is able to self-adapt to the streaming conditions by modeling and monitoring a set of context parameters. It further aggregates the available bandwidth by enabling multi-route streaming across cloud sites, while at the same time optimizing resource utilization and increasing cost efficiency. The prototype was validated on tens of nodes from US and Europe datacenters of the Windows Azure cloud with synthetic benchmarks and a real-life application monitoring the ALICE experiment at CERN. The results show a 3 x increase of the transfer rate using the adaptive multi-route streaming, compared to state of the art solutions. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Kofler2009355,Using MPEG-21 for cross-layer multimedia content adaptation,"This paper presents a cross-layer model- formulated using interoperable description formats-for the adaptation of scalable H.264/MPEG-4 AVC (i.e., SVC) content in a video streaming system operating on a Wireless LAN access network without QoS mechanisms. SVC content adaptation on the server takes place on the application layer using an adaptation process compliant with the MPEG-21 Digital Item Adaptation (DIA) standard, based on input comprised of MPEG-21 DIA descriptions of content and usage environment parameters. The latter descriptions integrate information from different layers, e.g., device characteristics and packet loss rate, in an attempt to increase the interoperability of this cross-layer model, thus making it applicable to other models. For the sake of deriving model parameters, performance measurements from two wireless access point models were taken in account. Throughout the investigation it emerged that the behavior of the system strongly depends on the access point. Therefore, we investigated the use of end-to-end-based rate control algorithms for steering the content adaptation. Simulations of rate adaptation algorithms were subsequently performed, leading to the conclusion that a TFRC-based adaptation technique (TCP-Friendly Rate Control) performs quite well in adapting to limited bandwidth and varying network conditions.

Marino2007234,Description and performance analysis of a distributed rendering architecture for virtual environments,"Complex Virtual Environments applications may require computational resources exceeding the capabilities of a single machine. Our system, called ""XVR Network Renderer"", allows rendering load to be distributed throughout a cluster of machines operating concurrently. The proposed solution consists in a set of software modules structured as a single-master multiple-slaves architecture. XVR is a development environment that allows rapid development of Virtual Environments applications. The master software intercepts all the OpenGL API calls performed by any XVR application, without requiring any code to be added or modified. The graphical commands are then reexecuted individually by the slave clients. Each slave is typically configured to manage only a subset of the whole virtual context. Our system exploits the tight integration with the underlying XVR. scene-graph manager at its own advantage, providing additional features other than the mere visualization of a high resolution OpenGL context, such as head tracking, GLSL shaders, and the ability to insert (and intercept) ""placemarkers"" inside the broadcast OpenGL data stream. Finally, the system can be configured to work with a wide range of complex visualization setups, automatically handling stereoscopy, correct perspective correction, overlapping images and other common problems, without ever changing the code of the original application.

As an attractive alternative to traditional service oriented architecture (SOA), Lambda architecture can be used in many use cases including BI tools, in-memory graph databases, OLAP, and streaming data processing. In practice, an important aim of Lambda's service providers is devising an efficient way to co-locate multiple Lambda functions with different attributes into a set of available computing resources.

Zhou2017,Efficient streaming mass spatio-temporal vehicle data access in urban sensor networks based on apache storm,"The efficient data access of streaming vehicle data is the foundation of analyzing, using and mining vehicle data in smart cities, which is an approach to understand traffic environments. However, the number of vehicles in urban cities has grown rapidly, reaching hundreds of thousands in number.

Mamouras2019670,Data-trace types for distributed stream processing systems,"Distributed architectures for efficient processing of streaming data are increasingly critical to modern information processing systems. The goal of this paper is to develop type-based programming abstractions that facilitate correct and efficient deployment of a logical specification of the desired computation on such architectures. In the proposed model, each communication link has an associated type specifying tagged data items along with a dependency relation over tags that captures the logical partial ordering constraints over data items. The semantics of a (distributed) stream processing system is then a function from input data traces to output data traces, where a data trace is an equivalence class of sequences of data items induced by the dependency relation. This data-trace transduction model generalizes both acyclic synchronous data-flow and relational query processors, and can specify computations over data streams with a rich variety of partial ordering and synchronization characteristics. We then describe a set of programming templates for data-trace transductions: abstractions corresponding to common stream processing tasks. Our system automatically maps these high-level programs to a given topology on the distributed implementation platform Apache Storm while preserving the semantics. Our experimental evaluation shows that (1) while automatic parallelization deployed by existing systems may not preserve semantics, particularly when the computation is sensitive to the ordering of data items, our programming abstractions allow a natural specification of the query that contains a mix of ordering constraints while guaranteeing correct deployment, and (2) the throughput of the automatically compiled distributed code is comparable to that of hand-crafted distributed implementations. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Maroulis201727,ExpREsS: EneRgy Efficient Scheduling of Mixed Stream and Batch Processing Workloads,"Nowadays we see the wide adoption of novel distributed processing frameworks such as Apache Spark for handling batch and stream processing big data applications. An important aspect that has not been examined in these systems is their energy consumption during the application execution. Reducing the power consumption of modern datacenters is a necessity as datacenters contribute over 2% of the total US electric usage. One way of addressing this energy issue is by scheduling the applications in an energy-efficient way. However, efficiently scheduling applications can be challenging as we need to consider the trade-off between the datacenter's energy usage and per application performance requirements. In this work we propose, ExpREsS, a scheduler for orchestrating the execution of Spark applications so that it both minimizes the energy consumption and satisfies the applications' performance requirements.

Then, we design and implement an adaptive task scheduler by adding load tracker to monitor the runtime status of the cluster and applying static and dynamic scheduling strategies. At last, we conduct experiments to assess our work by measuring average processing time, overall throughput and stability of the cluster through network bounded and CPU bounded benchmarks.

Bouillet2010249,"Scalable, real-time map-matching using IBM's System S","Vehicle GPS data is an essential ""raw"" material for a broad range of applications such as traffic management and control, routing, and navigation. To become useful, the data has to be related to the underlying road network by means of map matching algorithms, which are often computationally expensive. In addition, GPS data is not accurate and often needs to be cleaned to remove erroneous observations. In this paper, we describe how map matching can be run on IBM's System S, which provides a platform to run stream processing applications in a scalable manner. We show how various features of System S, including a component based programming model, data pipelining and parallelization of computation, help us to scale the map-matching and data cleaning processes, both as the rate of incoming GPS data increases and as the size of the underlying road network increases. We provide results of performance evaluations, where we show our system can match GPS data arriving at a rate of 1 million points per second onto a map with 1 billion links. © 2010 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,INCLUDED,INCLUDED,EXCLUDED,"Shows System S and only uses aa PS app, not very insightful","Bouillet, E. and Ranganathan, A.",2010,Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management,10.1109/MDM.2010.36,scopus-search1.bib

Marcu20181480,KerA: Scalable data ingestion for stream processing,"Big Data applications are increasingly moving from batch-oriented execution models to stream-based models that enable them to extract valuable insights close to real-time. To support this model, an essential part of the streaming processing pipeline is data ingestion, i.e., the collection of data from various sources (sensors, NoSQL stores, filesystems, etc.) and their delivery for processing. Data ingestion needs to support high throughput, low latency and must scale to a large number of both data producers and consumers. Since the overall performance of the whole stream processing pipeline is limited by that of the ingestion phase, it is critical to satisfy these performance goals. However, state-of-art data ingestion systems such as Apache Kafka build on static stream partitioning and offset-based record access, trading performance for design simplicity. In this paper we propose KerA, a data ingestion framework that alleviate the limitations of state-of-art thanks to a dynamic partitioning scheme and to lightweight indexing, thereby improving throughput, latency and scalability. Experimental evaluations show that KerA outperforms Kafka up to 4x for ingestion throughput and up to 5x for the overall stream processing throughput. Furthermore, they show that KerA is capable of delivering data fast enough to saturate the big data engine acting as the consumer. © 2018 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Marcu, O.-C. and Costan, A. and Antoniu, G. and Pérez-Hernández, M. and Nicolae, B. and Tudoran, R. and Bortoli, S.",2018,Proceedings - International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems,10.1109/ICDCS.2018.00152,scopus-search1.bib

Rate adaptation in this setting is inherently challenging due to the interplay between the variability of the wireless channels, the queuing at the network nodes, and the frame-based decoding and playback of the video content at the receiver at very short time scales.

The traditional MapReduce programming model is designed for batch-based large-scale data processing and cannot satisfy the real-time requirement. To extend the real-time data processing capability of MapReduce by preprocessing, pipelining and localizing, an immediate result cache for key/value data type, which can avoid repeated remote I/O overhead and computation cost by taking full use of local memory and storage, localize stream processing by distributing data across the clusters and support frequent reads and writes of data stream processing, needs to be designed. This paper proposes a scalable, extensible and efficient key/value intermediate result cache, which consists of Hash B-tree structures and SSTable files. Furthermore, to optimize the high concurrency performance, this paper also devises a probability-based B-tree structure as well as its multiplexing search algorithm through the B-tree balance property, and improves the file read/write strategy and replacement algorithm by utilization of the overhead estimation and buffered information.

Hsu2008,On the accuracy and complexity of rate-distortion models for fine-grained scalable video sequences,"Rate-distortion (R-D) models are functions that describe the relationship between the bitrate and expected level of distortion in the reconstructed video stream. R-D models enable optimization of the received video quality in different network conditions. Several R-D models have been proposed for the increasingly popular fine-grained scalable video sequences. However, the models' relative performance has not been thoroughly analyzed. Moreover, the time complexity of each model is not known, nor is the range of bitrates in which the model produces valid results. This lack of quantitative performance analysis makes it difficult to select the model that best suits a target streaming system. In this article, we classify, analyze, and rigorously evaluate all R-D models proposed for FGS coders in the literature. We classify R-D models into three categories: analytic, empirical, and semi-analytic. We describe the characteristics of each category. We analyze the R-D models by following their mathematical derivations, scrutinizing the assumptions made, and explaining when the assumptions fail and why. In addition, we implement all R-D models, a total of eight, and evaluate them using a diverse set of video sequences. In our evaluation, we consider various source characteristics, diverse channel conditions, different encoding/decoding parameters, different frame types, and several performance metrics including accuracy, range of applicability, and time complexity of each model. We also present clear systematic ways (pseudo codes) for constructing various R-D models from a given video sequence.

We present the Theodolite method for benchmarking the scalability of distributed stream processing engines. Core of this method is the definition of use cases that microservices implementing stream processing have to fulfill. For each use case, our method identifies relevant workload dimensions that might affect the scalability of a use case. We propose to design one benchmark per use case and relevant workload dimension. We present a general benchmarking framework, which can be applied to execute the individual benchmarks for a given use case and workload dimension. Our framework executes an implementation of the use case's dataflow architecture for different workloads of the given dimension and various numbers of processing instances.

Silvestre20211637,Clonos: Consistent Causal Recovery for Highly-Available Streaming Dataflows,"Stream processing lies in the backbone of modern businesses, being employed for mission critical applications such as real-time fraud detection, car-trip fare calculations, traffic management, and stock trading. Large-scale applications are executed by scale-out stream processing systems on thousands of long-lived operators, which are subject to failures. Recovering from failures fast and consistently are both top priorities, yet they are only partly satisfied by existing fault tolerance methods due to the strong assumptions these make. In particular, prior solutions fail to address consistency in the presence of nondeterminism, such as calls to external services, asynchronous timers and processing-time windows. This paper describes Clonos, a fault tolerance approach that achieves fast, local operator recovery with exactly-once guarantees and high availability by instantly switching to passive standby operators. Clonos enforces causally consistent recovery, including output deduplication, by tracking nondeterminism within the system through causal logging. To implement Clonos we re-engineered many of the internal subsystems of a state of the art stream processor. We evaluate Clonos' overhead and recovery on the Nexmark benchmark against Apache Flink.

Exploiting the parallelism afforded by such platforms, while preserving the semantics of the desired computation, is prone to errors, and motivates the development of tools for specification, testing, and verification. We focus on the problem of differential output testing for distributed stream processing systems, that is, checking whether two implementations produce equivalent output streams in response to a given input stream. The notion of equivalence allows reordering of logically independent data items, and the main technical contribution of the paper is an optimal online algorithm for checking this equivalence. Our testing framework is implemented as a library called DiffStream in Flink.

Akanbi20201,A distributed stream processing middleware framework for real-time analysis of heterogeneous data on big data platform: Case of environmental monitoring,"In recent years, the application and wide adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies have increased the proliferation of monitoring systems, which has consequently exponentially increased the amounts of heterogeneous data generated. Processing and analysing the massive amount of data produced is cumbersome and gradually moving from classical ‘batch’ processing—extract, transform, load (ETL) technique to real-time processing. For instance, in environmental monitoring and management domain, time-series data and historical dataset are crucial for prediction models. However, the environmental monitoring domain still utilises legacy systems, which complicates the real-time analysis of the essential data, integration with big data platforms and reliance on batch processing. Herein, as a solution, a distributed stream processing middleware framework for real-time analysis of heterogeneous environmental monitoring and management data is presented and tested on a cluster using open source technologies in a big data environment. The system ingests datasets from legacy systems and sensor data from heterogeneous automated weather systems irrespective of the data types to Apache Kafka topics using Kafka Connect APIs for processing by the Kafka streaming processing engine. The stream processing engine executes the predictive numerical models and algorithms represented in event processing (EP) languages for real-time analysis of the data streams. To prove the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implemented the system using a case study scenario of drought prediction and forecasting based on the Effective Drought Index (EDI) model. Firstly, we transform the predictive model into a form that could be executed by the streaming engine for real-time computing. Secondly, the model is applied to the ingested data streams and datasets to predict drought through persistent querying of the infinite streams to detect anomalies. As a conclusion of this study, a performance evaluation of the distributed stream processing middleware infrastructure is calculated to determine the real-time effectiveness of the framework. © 2020 by the authors.

Data Stream Processing Systems (DSPSs) are complex and powerful frameworks able to ease the development of streaming applications in distributed computing environments like clusters and clouds. Several systems of this kind have been released and currently maintained as open source projects, like Apache Storm and Spark Streaming. Some benchmark applications have often been used by the scientific community to test and evaluate new techniques to improve the performance and usability of DSPSs. However, the existing benchmark suites lack of representative workloads coming from the wide set of application domains that can leverage the benefits offered by the stream processing paradigm in terms of near real-time performance. The goal of this article is to present a new benchmark suite composed of 15 applications coming from areas like Finance, Telecommunications, Sensor Networks, Social Networks and others.

Lombardi2019342,PASCAL: An architecture for proactive auto-scaling of distributed services,"One of the main characteristics that today makes cloud services so popular is their ability to be elastic, i.e., they can adapt their provisioning to variable workloads, thus increasing resource utilization and reducing operating costs. At the core of any elastic service lies an automatic scaling mechanism that drives provisioning on the basis of a given strategy. In this paper we propose PASCAL, an architecture for Proactive Auto-SCALing of generic distributed services. PASCAL combines a proactive approach, to forecast incoming workloads, with a profiling system, to estimate required provision. Scale-in/out operations are decided according to an application-specific strategy, which aims at provisioning the minimum number of resources needed to sustain the foreseen workload. The main novelties introduced with PASCAL architecture are: (i) a strategy to proactively auto-scale a distributed stream processing system (namely, Apache Storm) with the aim of load balancing operators through an accurate system performance estimation model, and (ii) a strategy to proactively auto-scale a distributed datastore (namely, Apache Cassandra), focused on how to choose when executing scaling actions on the basis of the time needed for the activation/deactivation of storage nodes so as to have the configuration ready when needed. We provide a prototype implementation of PASCAL for both use cases and, through an experimental evaluation conducted on a private cloud, we validate our approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in terms of saved resources and response time.

Javed2018223,Cutting the Tail: Designing High Performance Message Brokers to Reduce Tail Latencies in Stream Processing,"Over the last decade, organizations have become heavily reliant on providing near-instantaneous insights to the end user based on vast amounts of data collected from various sources in real-time. In order to accomplish this task, a stream processing pipeline is constructed, which in its most basic form, consists of a Stream Processing Engine (SPE) and a Message Broker (MB). The SPE is responsible for performing actual computations on the data and providing insights from it. MB, on the other hand, acts as an intermediate queue to which data is written by ephemeral sources and then fetched by the SPE to perform computations on. Due to the inherent real-time nature of such a pipeline, low latency is a highly desirable feature for them. Thus, several existing research works in the community focus on improving latency and throughput of the streaming pipeline. However, there is a dearth of studies optimizing the tail latencies of such pipelines. Moreover, the root cause of this high tail latency is still vague. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to analyze in-depth the reasons behind high tail latency in streaming systems such as Apache Kafka. Having found the MB to be a major contributor of messages with high tail latencies in a streaming pipeline, we design and implement an RDMA-enhanced high-performance MB, called Frieda, with the higher goal of accelerating any arbitrary stream processing pipeline regardless of the SPE used. Our experiments show a reduction of up to 98% in 99.9th percentile latency for microbenchmarks and up to 31% for full-fledged stream processing pipeline constructed using Yahoo!

The LACore ISA was implemented in gcc, and a C-programming software framework, the LACoreAPI, has been developed for high-level programming of the LACore. Using the HPCC benchmark suite, we compare our LACore architecture against three other platforms: an in-order RISC-V CPU, a superscalar x86 CPU with SSE2, and a scaled NVIDIA Fermi GPU. The LACore outperforms the superscalar x86 processor in the benchmark suite by an average of 3.43x, and outperforms the scaled Fermi GPU by an average of 12.04x, within the same or less design area. © 2017 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Steffl, S. and Reda, S.",2017,"Proceedings - 35th IEEE International Conference on Computer Design, ICCD 2017",10.1109/ICCD.2017.29,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Ravindra201791,Latency aware elastic switching-based stream processing over compressed data streams,Elastic scaling of event stream processing systems has gained significant attention recently due to the prevalence of cloud computing technologies. We investigate on the complexities associated with elastic scaling of an event processing system in a private/public cloud scenario. We develop an Elastic Switching Mechanism (ESM) which reduces the overall average latency of event processing jobs by significant amount considering the cost of operating the system. ESM is augmented with adaptive compressing of upstream data. The ESM conducts one of the two types of switching where either part of the data is sent to the public cloud (data switching) or a selected query is sent to the public cloud (query switching) based on the characteristics of the query. We model the operation of the ESM as the function of two binary switching functions. We show that our elastic switching mechanism with compression is capable of handling out-of-order events more efficiently compared to techniques which does not involve compression. We used two application benchmarks called EmailProcessor and a Social Networking Benchmark (SNB2016) to conduct multiple experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. In a single query deployment with EmailProcessor benchmark we observed that our elastic switching mechanism provides 1.24 seconds average latency improvement per processed event which is 16.70% improvement compared to private cloud only deployment. When presented the option of scaling EmailProcessor with four public cloud VMs ESM further reduced the average latency by 37.55% compared to the single public cloud VM. In a multi-query deployment with both EmailProcessor and SNB2016 we obtained a reduction of average latency of both the queries by 39.61 seconds which is a decrease of 7% of overall latency. These performance figures indicate that our elastic switching mechanism with compressed data streams can effectively reduce the average elapsed time of stream processing happening in private/public clouds. © 2017 ACM.,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Ravindra, S. and Dayarathna, M. and Jayasena, S.",2017,ICPE 2017 - Proceedings of the 2017 ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering,10.1145/3030207.3030227,scopus-search1.bib;acm2-search1.bib

Whittier20132,Towards window stream queries over continuous phenomena,"Technological advances have created an unprecedented availability of inexpensive sensors capable of streaming environmental data in real-time. Data stream engines (DSE) with tuple processing rates of around 500k tuples/s have demonstrated their ability to both keep up with large numbers of spatio-temporal data streams, and execute stream window queries over them efficiently. Typically, geographically distributed sensors take samples asynchronously; however, when approximating the reality of a continuous phenomenon - - such as the radiation field over an urban region- the objective is to integrate their values correctly over space as well as over time. This paper presents an approach to extend DSEs with support enabling sliding window queries over dynamic continuous phenomena, which return both spatio-temporal snapshot and movies as window query results. We introduce a novel grid-pane index as a main memory index structure shared between multi-queries over a phenomenon and an adaptive, data driven kNN algorithm for efficiently approximating cells based on available stream data samples. AkNN implements a spatio-temporal inverse distance weighting interpolation (IDW) method that integrates time with space via an anisotropic ratio. Further, we introduce the shell list template that allows quick calculation of NN cells by distance in a space-time (ST) cuboid.

Mazur20111102,Towards scalable one-pass analytics using MapReduce,"An integral part of many data-intensive applications is the need to collect and analyze enormous datasets efficiently. Concurrent with such application needs is the increasing adoption of MapReduce as a programming model for processing large datasets using a cluster of machines. Current MapReduce systems, however, require the data set to be loaded into the cluster before running analytical queries, and thereby incur high delays to start query processing. Furthermore, existing systems are geared towards batch processing. In this paper, we seek to answer a fundamental question: what architectural changes are necessary to bring the benefits of the MapReduce computation model to incremental, one-pass analytics, i.e., to support stream processing and online aggregation? To answer this question, we first conduct a detailed empirical performance study of current MapReduce implementations including Hadoop and MapReduce Online using a variety of workloads. By doing so, we identify several drawbacks of existing systems for one-pass analytics. Based on the insights from our study, we list key design requirements for incremental one-pass analytics and argue for architectural changes of MapReduce systems to overcome their current limitations.

Tu200469,Performance analysis of a hybrid media streaming system,"Recent research efforts have demonstrated the promising potential of building cost-effective media streaming systems on top of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. A P2P media streaming architecture can reach large size and streaming capacity that are difficult to achieve in conventional server-based streaming services. Hybrid streaming systems that combine the use of dedicated streaming servers and P2P networks were proposed to build on the advantages of both paradigms. However, the dynamics of such systems and the impact of various factors on system behaviors are not totally clear. In this paper, we present an analytical framework to quantitatively study the features of a hybrid media streaming model. Based on this framework, we derive an equation to describe the capacity growth of a single-file streaming system. We then extend the analysis to multi-file scenarios by solving an optimization problem. We also show that the system model achieves optimal allocation of server bandwidth among different media objects. The unpredictable departure/failure of peers is a critical factor that affects performance of P2P systems. To model peer failures in our system, we propose the concept of peer lifespan.

Jonathan2020221,WASP: Wide-area Adaptive Stream Processing,"Adaptability is critical for stream processing systems to ensure stable, low-latency, and high-throughput processing of long-running queries. Such adaptability is particularly challenging for wide-area stream processing due to the highly dynamic nature of the wide-area environment, which includes unpredictable workload patterns, variable network bandwidth, occurrence of stragglers, and failures. Unfortunately, existing adaptation techniques typically achieve these performance goals by compromising the quality/accuracy of the results, and they are often application-dependent. In this work, we rethink the adaptability property of wide-area stream processing systems and propose a resource-aware adaptation framework, called WASP. WASP adapts queries through a combination of multiple techniques: task re-assignment, operator scaling, and query re-planning, and applies them in a WAN-aware manner. It is able to automatically determine which adaptation action to take depending on the type of queries, dynamics, and optimization goals. We have implemented a WASP prototype on Apache Flink.

However, state-of-the-art approaches for elastic stream processing do not consider the potential threats of exposing their data to third parties in cloud environments. We present the design and implementation of an Elastic Switching Mechanism for data stream processing which is based on homomorphic encryption (HomoESM). The HomoESM not only elastically scales data stream processing applications into public clouds but also preserves the privacy of such applications. Using a real-world test setup, which includes an E-mail Filter benchmark and a Web server access log processor benchmark (EDGAR), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on Amazon EC2 indicate that the proposed approach for homomorphic encryption provides a significant result which is 10–17% improvement in average latency in the case of E-mail Filter benchmark and EDGAR benchmark, respectively. Furthermore, EDGAR add/subtract operations, multiplication, and comparison operations showed up to 6.13%, 7.81%, and 26.17% average latency improvements, respectively.

Trotter2019136,Forecasting a Storm: Divining Optimal Configurations using Genetic Algorithms and Supervised Learning,"With the advent of Big Data platforms like Apache Storm, computations once deemed infeasible locally become possible at scale. However, doing so entails orchestrating powerful yet expensive clusters. With its focus on stream processing, Storm optimizes for low-latency and high throughput. However, to realize this goal and thereby maximize the utility of these clusters' resources, operators must execute these tasks under their optimal configurations. Yet, the search space for finding such configurations is so vast and time-consuming to explore so as to be effectively intractable due to issues like the temporal overhead of testing new candidate configurations, the sheer number of permutations of parameters within each configuration and their interdependence among each other. In order to efficiently cover the search space, we automate the process with genetic algorithms. Moreover, we fuse this technique not only with additional cluster information gleaned from JMX profiling and Storm performance data but also with classifiers constructed from training data from past executions of a plethora of Storm topologies. Utilizing a diverse set of Storm benchmark topologies as evaluation data, we show that the fully enhanced genetic algorithms can efficiently find configurations that perform on average 4.67x better than 'rules of thumb'-derived manual baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate that our fully refined classifiers enhance the GA throughput on average across the topologies by 22% while reducing search time by a factor of 6.47x. © 2019 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Trotter, M. and Wood, T. and Hwang, J.",2019,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing, ICAC 2019",10.1109/ICAC.2019.00025,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee1-search1.bib
Zvara2019578,Optimizing distributed data stream processing by tracing,"Heterogeneous mobile, sensor, IoT, smart environment, and social networking applications have recently started to produce unbounded, fast, and massive-scale streams of data that have to be processed “on the fly”. Systems that process such data have to be enhanced with detection for operational exceptions and with triggers for both automated and manual operator actions. In this paper, we illustrate how tracing in distributed data processing systems can be applied to detecting changes in data and operational environment to maintain the efficiency of heterogeneous data stream processing systems under potentially changing data quality and distribution. By the tracing of individual input records, we can (1) identify outliers in a web crawling and document processing system and use the insights to define URL filtering rules; (2) identify heavy keys, such as NULL, that should be filtered before processing; (3) give hints to improve the key-based partitioning mechanisms; and (4) measure the limits of overpartitioning if heavy thread-unsafe libraries are imported. By using Apache Spark as illustration, we show how various data stream processing efficiency issues can be mitigated or optimized by our distributed tracing engine. We describe and qualitatively compare two different designs, one based on reporting to a distributed database and another based on trace piggybacking. Our prototype implementation consists of wrappers suitable for JVM environments in general, with minimal impact on the source code of the core system.

Koo2020,IoT-enabled directed acyclic graph in spark cluster,"Real-time data streaming fetches live sensory segments of the dataset in the heterogeneous distributed computing environment. This process assembles data chunks at a rapid encapsulation rate through a streaming technique that bundles sensor segments into multiple micro-batches and extracts into a repository, respectively. Recently, the acquisition process is enhanced with an additional feature of exchanging IoT devices’ dataset comprised of two components: (i) sensory data and (ii) metadata. The body of sensory data includes record information, and the metadata part consists of logs, heterogeneous events, and routing path tables to transmit micro-batch streams into the repository. Real-time acquisition procedure uses the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to extract live query outcomes from in-place micro-batches through MapReduce stages and returns a result set. However, few bottlenecks affect the performance during the execution process, such as (i) homogeneous micro-batches formation only, (ii) complexity of dataset diversification, (iii) heterogeneous data tuples processing, and (iv) linear DAG workflow only. As a result, it produces huge processing latency and the additional cost of extracting event-enabled IoT datasets. Thus, the Spark cluster that processes Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) in a fast-pace using Random access memory (RAM) defies expected robustness in processing IoT streams in the distributed computing environment. This paper presents an IoT-enabled Directed Acyclic Graph (I-DAG) technique that labels micro-batches at the stage of building a stream event and arranges stream elements with event labels. In the next step, heterogeneous stream events are processed through the I-DAG workflow, which has non-linear DAG operation for extracting queries’ results in a Spark cluster.

Tantalaki2020117182,Pipeline-Based Linear Scheduling of Big Data Streams in the Cloud,"Nowadays, there is an accelerating need to efficiently and timely handle large amounts of data that arrives continuously. Streams of big data led to the emergence of several Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS) that assign processing tasks to the available resources (dynamically or not) and route streaming data between them. Efficient scheduling of processing tasks can reduce application latencies and eliminate network congestions. However, the available DSPSs' in-built scheduling techniques are far from optimal. In this work, we extend our previous work, where we proposed a linear scheme for the task allocation and scheduling problem. Our scheme takes advantage of pipelines to handle efficiently applications, where there is need for heavy communication (all-to-all) between tasks assigned to pairs of components. In this work, we prove that our scheme is periodic, we provide a communication refinement algorithm and a mechanism to handle many-to-one assignments efficiently. For concreteness, our work is illustrated based on Apache Storm semantics. The performance evaluation depicts that our algorithm achieves load balance and constraints the required buffer space. For throughput testing, we compared our work to the default Storm scheduler, as well as to R-Storm. Our scheme was found to outperform both the other strategies and achieved an average of 25%-40% improvement compared to Storm's default scheduler under different scenarios, mainly as a result of reduced buffering (approximate to 45% less memory).

Stehle2020616,ParPaRaw: Massively parallel parsing of delimiter-separated raw data,"Parsing is essential for a wide range of use cases, such as stream processing, bulk loading, and in-situ querying of raw data. Yet, the compute-intense step often constitutes a major bottleneck in the data ingestion pipeline, since parsing of inputs that require more involved parsing rules is challenging to parallelise. This work proposes a massively parallel algorithm for parsing delimiter-separated data formats on GPUs. Other than the state-of-the-art, the proposed approach does not require an initial sequential pass over the input to determine a thread's parsing context. That is, how a thread, beginning somewhere in the middle of the input, should interpret a certain symbol (e.g., whether to interpret a comma as a delimiter or as part of a larger string enclosed in double-quotes). Instead of tailoring the approach to a single format, we are able to perform a massively parallel finite state machine (FSM) simulation, which is more flexible and powerful, supporting more expressive parsing rules with general applicability. Achieving a parsing rate of as much as 14.2 GB/s, our experimental evaluation on a GPU with 3 584 cores shows that the presented approach is able to scale to thousands of cores and beyond. With an end-to-end streaming approach, we are able to exploit the full-duplex capabilities of the PCIe bus and hide latency from data transfers.

We find significant performance penalties when using Apache Beam for application development in the surveyed systems.

Renart2019885,An edge-based framework for enabling data-driven pipelines for IoT systems,"Due to the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, the number of devices connected to the Internet is growing. These devices are generating unprecedented amounts of data at the edges of the infrastructure. Although the generated data provides great potential, identifying and processing relevant data points hidden in streams of unimportant data, and doing this in near real time, remains a significant challenge. Existing stream processing platforms require the data to be transported to the cloud for processing, resulting in latencies that can prevent timely decision making or may reduce the amount of data processed. To tackle this problem, we designed an IoT Edge Framework, called R-Pulsar, that extends cloud capabilities to local devices and provides a programming model for deciding what, when, and where data get collected and processed. In this paper, we discuss motivating use cases and the architectural design of R-Pulsar. We have deployed and tested R-Pulsar on embedded devices (Raspberry Pi and Android phone) and present an experimental evaluation that demonstrates that R-Pulsar can enable timely data analytics by effectively leveraging edge and cloud resources. © 2019 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Renart, E.G. and Balouek-Thomert, D. and Parashar, M.",2019,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE 33rd International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops, IPDPSW 2019",10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00146,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Prosperi201942,Planner: Cost-Efficient Execution Plans Placement for Uniform Stream Analytics on Edge and Cloud,"Stream processing applications handle unbounded and continuous flows of data items which are generated from multiple geographically distributed sources. Two approaches are commonly used for processing: Cloud-based analytics and Edge analytics. The first one routes the whole data set to the Cloud, incurring significant costs and late results from the high latency networks that are traversed. The latter can give timely results but forces users to manually define which part of the computation should be executed on Edge and to interconnect it with the remaining part executed in the Cloud, leading to sub-optimal placements. In this paper, we introduce Planner, a middleware for uniform and transparent stream processing across Edge and Cloud. Planner automatically selects which parts of the execution graph will be executed at the Edge in order to minimize the network cost. Real-world micro-benchmarks show that Planner reduces the network usage by 40% and the makespan (end-to-end processing time) by 15% compared to state-of-the-art. © 2018 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Prosperi, L. and Costan, A. and Silva, P. and Antoniu, G.",2018,"Proceedings of WORKS 2018: 13th Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science, Held in conjunction with SC 2018: The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis",10.1109/WORKS.2018.00010,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Truong2018754,Performance Analysis of Large-Scale Distributed Stream Processing Systems on the Cloud,"Real-time data processing is often a necessity as it can provide insights that have less value if discovered off-line or after the fact. However, large-scale stream processing systems are non-trivial to build and deploy. While there are many frameworks that allow users to create large-scale distributed systems, there remains many challenges in understanding the performance, cost of deployment and considerations and impact of potential (partial) outages on real-time systems performance. Our work considers the performance of Cloud-based stream processing systems in terms of back-pressure and expected utilization. The performance of an exemplar stream application is explored using different Cloud-based virtual machine resources and where the scale of deployment and cost benefits are taken into consideration in relation to the overall performance. To achieve this, we develop an algorithm based on queueing theory to predict the throughput and latency of stream data processing while supporting system stability. Our methodology for making fundamental measurements is applicable to mainstream stream processing frameworks such as Apache Storm and Heron. The method is especially suitable for large-scale distributed stream processing where jobs can run for extended time periods.

However, introducing the Spark Structured Streaming in version 2.0 opened up completely new features for SparkSQL, which are alternatively only available in Apache Calcite. This work focuses on the new Spark Structured Streaming and analyses it by diving into its internal functionalities.

Dayarathna20171443,Energy consumption analysis of data stream processing: a benchmarking approach,"Energy efficiency of data analysis systems has become a very important issue in recent times because of the increasing costs of data center operations. Although distributed streaming workloads have increasingly been present in modern data centers, energy-efficient scheduling of such applications remains as a significant challenge. In this paper, we conduct an energy consumption analysis of data stream processing systems in order to identify their energy consumption patterns. We follow stream system benchmarking approach to solve this issue. Specifically, we implement Linear Road benchmark on six stream processing environments (S4, Storm, ActiveMQ, Esper, Kafka, and Spark Streaming) and characterize these systems' performance on a real-world data center. We study the energy consumption characteristics of each system with varying number of roads as well as with different types of component layouts. We also use a microbenchmark to capture raw energy consumption characteristics. We observed that S4, Esper, and Spark Streaming environments had highest average energy consumption efficiencies compared with the other systems. Using a neural networkbased technique with the power/performance information gathered from our experiments, we developed a model for the power consumption behavior of a streaming environment. We observed that energy-efficient execution of streaming application cannot be specifically attributed to the system CPU usage. We observed that communication between compute nodes with moderate tuple sizes and scheduling plans with balanced system overhead produces better power consumption behaviors in the context of data stream processing systems.

HoseinyFarahabady2017137,QoS-and Contention-Aware Resource Provisioning in a Stream Processing Engine,"This paper addresses the shared resource contention problem associated with the auto-parallelization of running queries in distributed stream processing engines. In such platforms, analyzing a large amount of data often requires to execute user-defined queries over continues raw-inputs in a parallel fashion at each single host. However, previous studies showed that the collocated applications can fiercely compete for shared resources, resulting in a severe performance degradation among applications. This paper presents an advanced resource allocation strategy for handling scenarios in which the target applications have different quality of service (QoS) requirements while shared-resource interference is considered as a key performance-limiting parameter.To properly allocate the best possible resource to each query, the proposed controller predicts the performance degradation of the running pane-level as well as the window-level queries when co-running with other queries. This is addressed as an optimization problem where a set of cost functions is defined to achieve the following goals: A) reduce the sum of QoS violation incidents over all machines; b) keep the CPU utilization level within an accepted range; and c) avoid fierce shared resource interference among collocated applications. Particle swarm optimization is used to find an acceptable solution at each round of the controlling period. The performance of the proposed solution is benchmarked with Round-Robin and best-effort strategies, and the experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed controller has the following advantages over its opponents: it increases the overall resource utilization by 15% on average while can reduce the average tuple latencies by 14%. It also achieves an average 123% improvement in preventing QoS violation incidents. © 2017 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"HoseinyFarahabady, M. and Zomaya, A.Y. and Tari, Z.",2017,"Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing, ICCC",10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.21,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee1-search1.bib
Wang2017107,Cloud-based integration and service of streaming data,"Big data management and processing are a good place where a Cloud infrastructure shows power. Service offers an important way to implement the delivery and usage model for various Cloud-based resources and abilities. With the prevalence of large-scale sensor data, the scale of system has expanded dramatically, the complexity of the multivariate and heterogeneous data has escalated, and the concurrency and frequency of streaming data has increased a lot. These bring great challenges to the traditional streaming data system in addressing issues in areas such as processing efficiency, scalability and fault tolerance. The Cloud computing techniques can be the foundation to manage and process large scale streaming data because of their high scalability, parallel processing capabilities, support of service delivery model and fault tolerance. The issue of streaming data integration and services based on Cloud computing is the focus of this paper. The paper starts with the application requirements of large-scale streaming data processing and integration, presents a framework for streaming integration, discusses the state-of-the-art key technologies including streaming data query, service customizations, mechanisms for scalability and reliability, evaluation metrics and benchmark etc. The uses of Cloud computing for large-scale streaming data integration and service provision are scrutinized, and challenges and future trends are summarized. © 2017, Science Press.

Recently, network coding has been introduced to improve the efficiency of these systems and to simplify the protocol design. There are already some successful commercial applications that utilize network coding. However, previous analytical studies of network-coding-based P2P streaming systems mainly focused on fundamental properties of the system and ignored the influence of the protocol details. In this study, a unique stochastic model is developed to reveal how segments of the video stream evolve over their lifetime in the buffer before they go into playback. Different strategies for segment selection have been studied with the model, and their performance has been compared. A new approximation of the probability of linear independence of coded blocks has been proposed to study the redundancy of network coding. Finally, extensive numerical results and simulations have been provided to validate our model. From these results, in-depth insights into how system parameters and segment selection strategies affect the performance of the system have been obtained. © 2015 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Saleh, B. and Qiu, D.",2016,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,10.1109/TNET.2015.2448597,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib
Zahmatkesh2016299,When a FILTER makes the difference in continuously answering SPARQL queries on streaming and quasi-static linked data,"We are witnessing a growing interest for Web applications that (i) require to continuously combine highly dynamic data stream with background data and (ii) have reactivity as key performance indicator. The Semantic Web community showed that RDF Stream Processing (RSP) is an adequate framework to develop this type of applications. However, when the background data is distributed over theWeb, even RSP engines risk losing reactiveness due to the time necessary to access the background data. State-of-the-art RSP engines remain reactive using a local replica of the background data, but such a replica progressively become stale if not updated to reflect the changes in the remote background data. For this reason, recently, the RSP community investigated maintenance policies (collectively named Acqua) that guarantee reactiveness while maximizing the freshness of the replica. Acqua’s policies apply to queries that join a basic graph pattern in a window clause with another basic graph pattern in a service clause. In this paper, we extend the class of queries considered in Acqua adding a FILTER clause that selects mapping in the background data. We propose a new maintenance policy (namely, the Filter Update Policy) and we show how to combine it with Acqua policies. A set of experimental evaluations empirically proves the ability of the proposed policies to guarantee reactiveness while keeping the replica fresher than with the Acqua policies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Zahmatkesh, S. and DellaValle, E. and Dell’Aglio, D.",2016,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10.1007/978-3-319-38791-8_17,scopus-search1.bib

In this paper, we present Exathlon, the first comprehensive public benchmark for explainable anomaly detection over high-dimensional time series data. Exathlon has been systematically constructed based on real data traces from repeated executions of large-scale stream processing jobs on an Apache Spark cluster. Some of these executions were intentionally disturbed by introducing instances of six different types of anomalous events (e.g., misbehaving inputs, resource contention, process failures). For each of the anomaly instances, ground truth labels for the root cause interval as well as those for the extended effect interval are provided, supporting the development and evaluation of a wide range of anomaly detection (AD) and explanation discovery (ED) tasks.

Wang20201628,Online Computation Performance Analysis for Distributed Machine Learning Pipelines in Fog Manufacturing,"Smart manufacturing enables real-time data streaming from interconnected manufacturing processes to improve manufacturing quality, throughput, flexibility, and cost reduction via computation services. In these computation services, machine learning pipelines integrate various types of computation method options to match the contextualized, on-demand computation needs for the maximum prediction accuracy or the best model structure interpretation. On the other hand, there is a pressing need to integrate Fog computing in manufacturing, which will reduce communication time latency and dependency on connections, improve responsiveness and reliability of the computation services, and maintain data privacy. However, there is a knowledge gap in using machine learning pipelines in Fog manufacturing. Existing offloading strategies are not effective, due to the lack of accurate prediction model for the performance of computation services before the execution of those heterogeneous computation tasks. In this paper, machine learning pipelines are implemented in Fog manufacturing. The computation performance of each sub-step of pipelines is predicted and analyzed via linear regression models and random forest regression models. A Fog manufacturing testbed is adopted to validate the performance of the employed models. The results show that the models can adequately predict the performance of computation services, which can be further integrated into Fog manufacturing to better support offloading strategies for machine learning pipelines. © 2020 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Wang, L. and Zhang, Y. and Chen, X. and Jin, R.",2020,IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering,10.1109/CASE48305.2020.9216979,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib
RezaHoseinyfarahabady2020629,Q-Flink: A QoS-Aware Controller for Apache Flink,"Modern stream-data processing platforms are required to execute processing pipelines over high-volume, yet high-velocity, datasets under tight latency constraints. Apache Flink has emerged as an important new technology of large-scale platform that can distribute processing over a large number of computing nodes in a cluster (i.e., scale-out processing). Flink allows application developers to design and execute queries over continuous raw-inputs to analyze a large amount of streaming data in a parallel and distributed fashion. To increase the throughput of computing resources in stream processing platforms, a service provider might be tempted to use a consolidation strategy to pack as many processing applications as possible on the working nodes, with the hope of increasing the total revenue by improving the overall resource utilization. However, there is a hidden trap for achieving such a higher throughput solely by relying on an interference-oblivious consolidation strategy. In practice, collocated applications in a shared platform can fiercely compete with each others for obtaining the capacity of shared resources (e.g., cache and memory bandwidth) which in turn can lead to a severe performance degradation for all consolidated workloads.This paper addresses the shared resource contention problem associated with the auto-resource controlling mechanism of Apache Flink engine running across a distributed cluster. A controlling strategy is proposed to handle scenarios in which stream processing applications may have different quality of service (QoS) requirements while the resource interference is considered as the key performance-limiting parameter. The performance evaluation is carried out by comparing the proposed controller with the default Flink resource allocation strategy in a testbed cluster with total 32 Intel Xeon cores under different workload traffic with up to 4000 streaming applications chosen from various benchmarking tools. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed controller can successfully decrease the average latency of high priority applications by 223% during the burst traffic while maintaining the requested QoS enforcement levels. © 2020 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"RezaHoseinyfarahabady, M. and Jannesari, A. and Taheri, J. and Bao, W. and Zomaya, A.Y. and Tari, Z.",2020,"Proceedings - 20th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing, CCGRID 2020",10.1109/CCGrid49817.2020.00-30,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib
Ordonez-Ante2020,Explora: Interactive querying of multidimensional data in the context of smart cities,"Citizen engagement is one of the key factors for smart city initiatives to remain sustainable over time. This in turn entails providing citizens and other relevant stakeholders with the latest data and tools that enable them to derive insights that add value to their day-to-day life. The massive volume of data being constantly produced in these smart city environments makes satisfying this requirement particularly challenging. This paper introduces EXPLORA, a generic framework for serving interactive low-latency requests, typical of visual exploratory applications on spatiotemporal data, which leverages the stream processing for deriving—on ingestion time—synopsis data structures that concisely capture the spatial and temporal trends and dynamics of the sensed variables and serve as compacted data sets to provide fast (approximate) answers to visual queries on smart city data. The experimental evaluation conducted on proof-of-concept implementations of EXPLORA, based on traditional database and distributed data processing setups, accounts for a decrease of up to 2 orders of magnitude in query latency compared to queries running on the base raw data at the expense of less than 10% query accuracy and 30% data footprint. The implementation of the framework on real smart city data along with the obtained experimental results prove the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2020 by the authors.

Henning20193512,Scalable and Reliable Multi-Dimensional Aggregation of Sensor Data Streams,"Ever-increasing amounts of data and requirements to process them in real time lead to more and more analytics platforms and software systems being designed according to the concept of stream processing. A common area of application is the processing of continuous data streams from sensors, for example, IoT devices or performance monitoring tools. In addition to analyzing pure sensor data, analyses of data for groups of sensors often need to be performed as well. Therefore, data streams of the individual sensors have to be continuously aggregated to a data stream for a group. Motivated by a real-world application scenario, we propose that such a stream aggregation approach has to allow for aggregating sensors in hierarchical groups, support multiple such hierarchies in parallel, provide reconfiguration at runtime, and preserve the scalability and reliability qualities induced by applying stream processing techniques. We propose a stream processing architecture fulfilling these requirements, which can be integrated into existing big data architectures. We present a pilot implementation of such an extended architecture and show how it is used in industry. Furthermore, in experimental evaluations we show that our solution scales linearly with the amount of sensors and provides adequate reliability in the case of faults. © 2019 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Henning, S. and Hasselbring, W.",2019,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2019",10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006452,scopus-search1.bib
Bartnik2019127,On-the-fly reconfiguration of query plans for stateful stream processing engines,"Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) must tolerate the dynamic nature of unbounded data streams and provide means to quickly adapt to fluctuations in the data rate. Many major SPEs however provide very little functionality to adjust the execution of a potentially infinite streaming query at runtime. Each modification requires a complete query restart, which involves an expensive redistribution of the state of a query and may require external systems in order to guarantee correct processing semantics. This results in significant downtime, which increase the operational cost of those SPEs. We present a modification protocol that enables modifying specific operators as well as the data flow of a running query while ensuring exactly-once processing semantics. We provide an implementation for Apache Flink, which enables stateful operator migration across machines, the introduction of new operators into a running query, and changes to a specific operator based on external triggers. Our results on two benchmarks show that migrating operators for queries with small state is as fast as using the savepoint mechanism of Flink. Migrating operators in the presence of large state even outperforms the savepoint mechanism by a factor of more than 2.3. Introducing and replacing operators at runtime is performed in less than 10 s. Our modification protocol demonstrates the general feasibility of runtime modifications and opens the door for many other modification use cases, such as online algorithm tweaking and up- or downscaling operator instances. © 2019 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

Nardelli201953,A multi-level elasticity framework for distributed data stream processing,"Data Stream Processing (DSP) applications should be capable to efficiently process high-velocity continuous data streams by elastically scaling the parallelism degree of their operators so to deal with high variability in the workload.

In this paper we propose E2DF, a framework to autonomously control the multi-level elasticity of DSP applications and the underlying computing infrastructure. E2DF revolves around a hierarchical approach, with two control layers that work at different granularity and time scale. At the lower level, fully decentralized Operator and Region managers control the reconfiguration of distributed DSP operators and resources. At the higher level, centralized managers oversee the overall application and infrastructure adaptation.

To this end, we propose an efficient STEA filtering pipeline based on the recently proposed permeability filter (PF), which offers high quality and halo reduction capabilities. Using mathematical properties of the PF, we reformulate its temporal extension as a causal, non-linear infinite impulse response filter, which can be efficiently evaluated due to its incremental nature. We bootstrap our own accurate flow using the PF and its temporal extension by interpolating a quasi-dense nearest neighbour field obtained with an improved PatchMatch algorithm, which employs binarized octal orientation maps (BOOM) descriptors to find correspondences among subsequent frames. Our method is able to create temporally consistent results for a variety of applications such as optical flow estimation, sparse data upsampling, visual saliency computation and disparity estimation. We benchmark our optical flow estimation on the MPI Sintel dataset, where we currently achieve a Pareto optimal quality-efficiency tradeoff with an average endpoint error of 7.68 at 0.59 s single-core execution time on a recent desktop machine. © 2017 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Schaffner, M. and Scheidegger, F. and Cavigelli, L. and Kaeslin, H. and Benini, L. and Smolic, A.",2018,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2017.2757259,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee1-search1.bib

LeVan2017238,Optimizing the performance of concurrent RDF stream processing queries,"With the growing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) and sensing technologies, a large number of data streams are being generated at a very rapid pace. To explore the potentials of the integration of IoT and semantic technologies, a few RDF Stream Processing (RSP) query engines are made available which are capable of processing, analyzing and reasoning over semantic data streams in real-time. This way, RSP mitigates data interoperability issues and promotes knowledge discovery and smart decision making for time-sensitive applications. However, a major hurdle in the wide adoption of RSP systems is their query performance. Particularly, the ability of RSP engines to handle a large number of concurrent queries is very limited which refrains large scale stream processing applications (e.g. smart city applications) to adopt RSP. In this paper, we propose a shared-join based approach to improve the performance of an RSP engine for concurrent queries. We also leverage query federation mechanisms to allow distributed query processing over multiple RSP engine instances in order to gain performance for concurrent and distributed queries. We apply load balancing strategies to distribute queries and further optimize the concurrent query performance.

Variants of P2P protocols are also applied for other media distribution such as audio and video streaming. The P2P protocol is widely adapted by researchers as a method to handle larger group of users. Coolstreaming, the first large scale P2P streaming experiment till today, applied a mesh-based streaming system which has slowly evolved from a pure pull system to a hybrid push-pull system. In this paper, we present our proposed push-pull scheduling for P2P streaming that can heuristically select the most optimal frame to be pushed based on the rules that we designed. Our proposed solution incorporates the fast content distribution characteristic of both Push and Pull approaches. For performance evaluation, we compare our scheduling algorithm with the pure pull Coolstreaming scheduling and Random push-pull scheduling where both scheduling serve as a benchmark in three main criteria - end-to-end delay, frame miss-ratio and frame redundancy.

Shen2008106,Lineage-based probabilistic event stream processing,"Many sensor network applications such as monitoring video camera streams or management of RFID data streams or tiny sensor data streams from Motes or SunSPOTs require the ability to detect composite events over high-volume data streams. Sensor data inputs from physical world are usually noisy, incomplete and unreliable because sensing devices are usually unreliable. Thus they are usually expressed with probability in ubiquitous sensor network environment. To manage this kind of data, the probabilistic event stream processing system is a natural consequence. In this paper, we propose a query language to support probabilistic queries for composite event stream matching. The language allows users to express Kleene closure patterns for complex event detection in physical world. We also propose a working framework for query processing over probabilistic event streams. Our method first detects sequence patterns over probabilistic data streams by using a new data structure, AIG which handles a record sets of active states with a NFA-based approach. After detecting active states, our method then computes the probability of each detected sequence pattern on its lineage. That is, query processing and confidence computation are decoupled. By the benefit of lineage, the probability of an output event can be directly calculated without considering the query plan. We conduct a performance evaluation of our method comparing with naive one which is called possible worlds approach. The result clearly shows the effectiveness of our approach. While our approach shows scalable throughput, naive approach degrades its performance rapidly.

The requirements for processing large volumes of streaming data at real time have posed many great design challenges. It is critical to optimize the ongoing resource consumption of multiple, distributed, cooperating, processing units. In this paper, we consider a generic model for the general stream data processing systems. We address the resource allocation problem for a collection of processing units so as to maximize the weighted sum of the throughput of different streams. Each processing unit may require multiple input data streams simultaneously and produce one or many valuable output streams. Data streams flow through such a system after processing at multiple processing units.

Nandi2022340,A federated learning method for real-time emotion state classification from multi-modal streaming,"Emotional and physical health are strongly connected and should be taken care of simultaneously to ensure completely healthy persons. A person's emotional health can be determined by detecting emotional states from various physiological measurements (EDA, RB, EEG, etc.). Affective Computing has become the field of interest, which uses software and hardware to detect emotional states. In the IoT era, wearable sensor-based real-time multi-modal emotion state classification has become one of the hottest topics. In such setting, a data stream is generated from wearable-sensor devices, data accessibility is restricted to those devices only and usually a high data generation rate should be processed to achieve real-time emotion state responses. Additionally, protecting the users’ data privacy makes the processing of such data even more challenging. Traditional classifiers have limitations to achieve high accuracy of emotional state detection under demanding requirements of decentralized data and protecting users’ privacy of sensitive information as such classifiers need to see all data. Here comes the federated learning, whose main idea is to create a global classifier without accessing the users’ local data. Therefore, we have developed a federated learning framework for real-time emotion state classification using multi-modal physiological data streams from wearable sensors, called Fed-ReMECS. The main findings of our Fed-ReMECS framework are the development of an efficient and scalable real-time emotion classification system from distributed multimodal physiological data streams, where the global classifier is built without accessing (privacy protection) the users’ data in an IoT environment. The experimental study is conducted using the popularly used multi-modal benchmark DEAP dataset for emotion classification.

Eskandari2021219,I-Scheduler: Iterative scheduling for distributed stream processing systems,"Task allocation in Data Stream Processing Systems (DSPSs) has a significant impact on performance metrics such as data processing latency and system throughput. An application processed by DSPSs can be represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each vertex represents a task and the edges show the dataflow between the tasks. Task allocation can be defined as the assignment of the vertices in the DAG to the physical compute nodes such that the data movement between the nodes is minimised. Finding an optimal task placement for DSPSs is NP-hard. Thus, approximate scheduling approaches are required to improve the performance of DSPSs. In this paper, we propose a heuristic scheduling algorithm which reliably and efficiently finds highly communicating tasks by exploiting graph partitioning algorithms and a mathematical optimisation software package. We evaluate the communication cost of our method using three micro-benchmarks, showing that we can achieve results that are close to optimal. We further compare our scheduler with two popular existing schedulers, R-Storm and Aniello et al.'s `Online scheduler' using two real-world applications.

One of their key features is built-in fault tolerance. In this work, we dive deeper into the implementation, performance, and efficiency of this critical feature for four state-of-the-art frameworks. We include the established Spark Streaming and Flink frameworks and the more novel Spark Structured Streaming and Kafka Streams frameworks. We test the behavior under different types of faults and settings: master failure with and without high-availability setups, driver failures for Spark frameworks, worker failure with or without exactly-once semantics, application and task failures. We highlight differences in behavior during these failures on several aspects, e.g., whether there is an outage, downtime, recovery time, data loss, duplicate processing, accuracy, and the cost and behavior of different message delivery guarantees. Our results highlight the impact of framework design on the speed of fault recovery and explain how different use cases may benefit from different approaches. Due to their task-based scheduling approach, the Spark frameworks can recover within 30 seconds and in most cases without necessitating an application restart. Kafka Streams has only a few seconds of downtime, but is slower at catching up on delays. Finally, Flink can offer end-to-end exactly-once semantics at a low cost but requires job restarts for most failures leading to high recovery times of around 50 seconds. © 2013 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,INCLUDED,INCLUDED,,,"VanDongen, G. and Poel, D.V.D.",2021,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3093208,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib;scholar.bib

To address this gap, we engineer a modular edge cloud computing system architecture that is built on latest advances in containerization techniques, including Kafka, for data streaming, Docker, as application platform, and Firebase Cloud, as realtime database system. We benchmark the performance of the system in terms of scalability, resource utilization and latency by comparing three scenarios: cloud-only, edge-only and combined edge-cloud. The measurements show that edge-only solution outperforms other scenarios only when deployed with data located at one edge only, i.e., without edge computing wide data synchronization. In case of applications requiring data synchronization through the cloud, edge-cloud scales around a factor 10 times better than cloudonly, until certain number of concurrent users in the system, and above this point, cloud-only scales better. In terms of resource utilization, we observe that whereas the mean utilization increases linearly with the number of user requests, the maximum values for the memory and the network I/O heavily increase when with an increasing amount of data. © 2020 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Carpio, F. and Delgado, M. and Jukan, A.",2020,IEEE International Conference on Communications,10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9148636,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib
Onishi202066,Recovery-conscious adaptive watermark generation for time-order event stream processing,"Achieving low latency in time-order real-time event stream processing of data produced by a large number of IoT devices is difficult due to the buffering time required for sorting event messages arrived. Despite the existence of real-time IoT applications that highly depend on the order of event occurrences, event messages arriving from the devices to the event processing system are not time-ordered in many cases. Therefore, such an event processing system needs to buffer arriving event messages, sort, and then process them. This buffering time tends to be decided as a safe large period to guarantee correctness in terms of time-ordering, and leads to an increase of latency. Furthermore, failure recovery mechanism of a stateful stream processing deployed into distributed processing nodes makes this problem more difficult. It frequently causes large time-order reversal among event messages in the distributed stream processing system, that cannot be handled with a buffering time designed for real-time processing during normal periods. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique to adaptively determine the minimum necessary amount of buffering time to guarantee time-order sorting depending on the event-time progress in arrival event messages. To be more precise, instead of specifying the actual buffering time, the method adaptively controls the minimum time margin to determine the current 'watermark' that shows the event time upon which a processing unit in a distributed stream processing system believes to have received all the messages. Further, we developed a complete function (called 'time alignment') to sort the time-order of messages while keeping low latency in our developed distributed event stream processing platform. Through the experimental evaluations, it is shown that the developed method has the capability to determine a proper watermark to achieve both a strong guarantee on time-order correctness and low latency in real-time event stream processing. © 2020 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Onishi, T. and Michaelis, J. and Kanemasa, Y.",2020,"Proceedings - 5th ACM/IEEE Conference on Internet of Things Design and Implementation, IoTDI 2020",10.1109/IoTDI49375.2020.00014,scopus-search1.bib

Prasad2020,Ensemble framework for concept-drift detection in multidimensional streaming data,"The potential objective of data mining (DM) over the data streaming is the detection of concept-drift. Concept-Drift signifies a diversity among the data tuples streamed in the sequence. The concept-drift often appears as incremental or abrupt. The incremental drift denotes the gradual increment of the drift between the tuples of streaming data. The other format of the drift is abrupt, which signifies the drift between tuples of data streaming in sequence. The proposed method is an Ensemble Framework for Concept-Drift Detection in Multidimensional Streaming Data (EFCDD). In addition, the proposed method EFCDD deals with the recurrent drift of the concept in streaming data. To state the drift, the projection diversity of the values representing the field positions or field-IDs, which are in use for framing the structure of the records streaming form the intended sources. The experimental study was carried out by mocking the streams of those transmitting records of the benchmark datasets often used in DM. The outcomes of the experimental study evince the scalability and prominence of EFCDD toward the detection of drift in concept.

Fang20192471,Integrating workload balancing and fault tolerance in distributed stream processing system,"Distributed Stream Processing Engine (DSPE) is designed for processing continuous streams so as to achieve the real-time performance with low latency guaranteed. To satisfy such requirement, the availability and efficiency are the main concern of the DSPE system, which can be achieved by a proper design of the fault tolerance module and the workload balancing module, respectively. However, the inherent characteristics of data streams, including persistence, dynamic and unpredictability, pose great challenges in satisfying both properties. As far as we know, most of the state-of-the-art DSPE systems take either fault tolerance or workload balancing as its single optimization goal, which in turn receives a higher resource overhead or longer recovery time. In this paper, we combine the fault tolerance and workload balancing mechanisms in the DSPE to reduce the overall resource consumption while keeping the system interactive, high-throughput, scalable and highly available. Based on our data-level replication strategy, our method can handle the dynamic data skewness and node failure scenario: during the distribution fluctuation of the incoming stream, we rebalance the workload by selectively inactivate the data in high-load nodes and activate their replicas on low-load nodes to minimize the migration overhead within the stateful operator; when a fault occurs in the process, the system activates the replicas of the data affected to ensure the correctness while keeping the workload balanced.

The predictions of the two streams are fused using deep neural networks. The proposed method has been validated on a public benchmark dataset of 17 patients, each with 40 temporal volumes. When averaged over three experiments, a highly competitive Dice overlap score of 0.8688 and sensitivity of 0.8694 were achieved. As a spatiotemporal segmentation method, it can easily migrate to other datasets. © 2019 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Kang, J. and Samarasinghe, G. and Senanayake, U. and Conjeti, S. and Sowmya, A.",2019,Proceedings - International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging,10.1109/ISBI.2019.8759314,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Wang2019773,An on-the-fly scheduling strategy for distributed stream processing platform,"Distributed stream processing can accomplish real-time processing of continuous streaming big data to obtain valuable information with high velocity. To maintain continuously stable and efficient running of stream applications, however, continuous online scheduling operations are required in the context of highly dynamic data stream. For this reason, this paper proposes the on-the-fly scheduling strategy in a distributed stream processing environment, which dynamically predicts abnormal events through double exponential smoothing and adopts traffic-aware active migration protocol to adjust the network routing structure on-the-fly to balance the inter-worker load. Moreover, an evaluation method is proposed to quantitatively analyze the various scheduling objectives. Finally, we commendably apply the scheduling strategy to a stream processing platform, which regards docker instance as basic scheduling units. Meanwhile, based on the platform and the evaluation method, we complete performance comparison experiments of the scheduling algorithm.

Sahin2017,C-Stream: A co-routine-based elastic stream processing engine,"Stream processing is a computational paradigm for on-the-fly processing of live data. This paradigm lends itself to implementations that can provide high throughput and low latency by taking advantage of various forms of parallelism that are naturally captured by the stream processing model of computation, such as pipeline, task, and data parallelism. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of C-Stream, which is an elastic stream processing engine. C-Stream encompasses three unique properties. First, in contrast to the widely adopted event-based interface for developing streaming operators, C-Stream provides an interface wherein each operator has its own driver loop and relies on data availability application programming interfaces (APIs) to decide when to perform its computations. This self-control-based model significantly simplifies the development of operators that require multiport synchronization. Second, C-Stream contains a dynamic scheduler that manages the multithreaded execution of the operators. The scheduler, which is customizable via plug-ins, enables the execution of the operators as co-routines, using any number of threads. The base scheduler implements back-pressure, provides data availability APIs, and manages preemption and termination handling. Last, C-Stream varies the degree of parallelism to resolve bottlenecks by both dynamically changing the number of threads used to execute an application and adjusting the number of replicas of data-parallel operators.We provide an experimental evaluation of C-Stream. The results show that C-Stream is scalable, highly customizable, and can resolve bottlenecks by dynamically adjusting the level of data parallelism used. © 2017 ACM.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Sahin, S. and Gedik, B.",2017,ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing,10.1145/3184120,scopus-search1.bib;acm1-search1.bib

Some cloud service providers utilise the data to find public sentiments for the tenants. The challenge is how to clean the big data in the cloud before making further analysis. To address this issue, we propose a new live entity resolution approach at a time to find duplicates from the news and tweet data. We investigate possible solutions to address live entity resolution in the cloud, to make sliding window size adaptive using multistep distance and window size dependent duplicate count strategy with alterable window step, and find duplicates by overlapping boundary objects in adjacent blocks.

Su2015949,Achieving self-aware parallelism in stream programs,"The age of big data open the door to a new approach in data exploration and utilization. With the increasing complexities and dynamics of modern IT systems and services, it has become a challenge to effectively exploit parallelism on multicore platforms in computing systems that are heterogeneous, dynamic and decentralised. Self-aware software is a response to these demands in dealing with distributed applications in changing environments. It is a closed-loop system with a series of optimization strategies to adjust itself dynamicly during data processing. We focus on incorporating adaptation mechanisms into the stream programs for exposing distributed parallelism. In the traditional stream programming models, changing data and status normally require human supervision to adjust the stream graph for performance. As one-time optimization strategy, the reconfiguration and maintenance lead to costly and time-consuming procedures during the operating phase. To address these problems, we propose a self-aware stream programming model called StreamAware. A key property of this model is that exposing self-aware parallelism in the message driven execution paradigm, which provides dynamic and reconfigurable stream graph in adapting to the data flow changes. The model defines the self-awareness loop based on finite state machine for stream applications to adjust their own stream graph with continuous optimization strategy. This paper presents three different self-aware systems built using StreamAware. The empirical evaluation demonstrate how these systems can exploit self-aware parallelism using the Parsec benchmark problems, optimize performance per Watt, and respond to significant changes in stream processing. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Su, Y. and Shi, F. and Talpur, S. and Wang, Y. and Hu, S. and Wei, J.",2015,Cluster Computing,10.1007/s10586-014-0412-x,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib
Rooholamin2015237,Modular vector processor architecture targeting at data-level parallelism,"Taking advantage of DLP (Data-Level Parallelism) is indispensable in most data streaming and multimedia applications. Several architectures have been proposed to improve both the performance and energy consumption for such applications. Superscalar and VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) processors along with SIMD (Single-Instruction Multiple-Data) and vector processor (VP) accelerators, are among the available options for designers to accomplish their desired requirements. We present an innovative architecture for a VP which separates the path for performing data shuffle and memory-indexed accesses from the data path for executing other vector instructions that access the memory. This separation speeds up the most common memory access operations by avoiding extra delays and unnecessary stalls. In our lane-based VP design, each vector lane uses its own private memory to avoid any stalls during memory access instructions. The proposed VP, which is developed in VHDL and prototyped on an FPGA, serves as a coprocessor for one or more scalar cores. Benchmarking shows that our VP can achieve very high performance. For example, it achieves a larger than 1500-fold speedup in the color space converting benchmark compared to running the code on a scalar core. The inclusion of distributed data shuffle engines across vector lanes has a spectacular impact on the execution time, primarily for applications like FFT (Fast-Fourier Transform) that require large amounts of data shuffling. Compared to running the benchmark on a VP without the shuffle engines, the speedup is 5.92 and 7.33 for the 64-point FFT without and with compiler optimization, respectively. Compared to runs on the scalar core, the achieved speed-ups for this benchmark are 52.07 and 110.45 without and with compiler optimization, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Seyfabad2014908,CAC-live: Centralized assisted cloud P2P live streaming,"Peer-to-Peer (P2P) live video streaming over the Internet is a developing technology that recently has gained more attention. The use of P2P network with leveraging of local resources of peers, increases scalability and reduces costs. One of the limitations of P2P live video streaming systems is the lack of adequate resources such as available upload bandwidth, both at video source and inside P2P overlay network that lead to reduce the quality of service (QoS) experienced by the users. One solution for this problem is to employ additional on-demand resources such as virtual machines (VM) that are rented from a cloud provider to increase the amount of total available bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an architecture for improving the QoS of the peers by using virtual machines (VMs) dynamically are rented from cloud providers.

Viel2014199,Data stream partitioning re-optimization based on runtime dependency mining,"In distributed data stream processing, a program made of multiple queries can be parallelized by partitioning input streams according to the values of specific attributes, or partitioning keys. Applying different partitioning keys to different queries requires re-partitioning intermediary streams, causing extra communication and reduced throughput. Re-partitionings can be avoided by detecting dependencies between the partitioning keys applicable to each query. Existing partitioning optimization methods analyze query syntax at compile-time to detect inter-key dependencies and avoid re-partitionings. This paper extends those compile-time methods by adding a runtime re-optimization step based on the mining of temporal approximate dependencies (TADs) between partitioning keys. A TAD is defined in this paper as a type of dependency that can be approximately valid over a moving time window.

Poor scalability and poor internal data pressure may result from serial dependencies within or between the algorithms.

To maximize the throughput and minimize the latency of parallel stream-processing applications, we propose an approach that complements run-time dynamic load balancing with static pre-compile partitioning. In our solution, the dynamic features are based on event-driven scheduling, while the static features benefit from profile-guided automatic optimizations.

Probabilistic model checking can evaluate performance, dependability and stability of information processing systems with random behaviors. We apply a hybrid analysis approach onto real-time distributed systems. In the hybrid analysis approach, we perform stepwise analysis using probabilistic models of target systems in different abstract levels. First, we create a probabilistic model with detailed behavior of the system (called detailed model), and apply simulation on the detailed model. Next, based on the simulation results, we create a probabilistic model in an abstract level (called simplified model). Then, we verify qualitative properties using the probabilistic model checking techniques. This prevents from state-explosion. We evaluate the validity of our approach by comparing to simulation results of NS-2 using a case study of a video data streaming system.

Although scheduling algorithms directly impact the user-perceived visual quality in streaming sessions, they have not been rigorously analyzed in the literature. In this paper, we first conduct an extensive experimental study to evaluate various scheduling algorithms on many PlanetLab nodes distributed all over the world. We study three important performance metrics: (i) continuity index which captures the smoothness of the video playback, (ii) load balancing index which indicates how the load is spread across sending peers, and (iii) buffering delay required to ensure continuous playback. Our experimental analysis reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each scheduling algorithm, and provides insights for developing better ones in order to improve the overall performance of P2P streaming systems. Then, we propose a new scheduling algorithm called On-time Delivery of VBR streams (ODV).

In comparison with on-demand media streaming, P2P live media streaming faces a very stringent time constraint. To improve the performance metrics, such as startup delay, source-to-end delay, and playback continuity, we present PALMS - a P2P approach for live media streaming where a node employs gossip-based pull and push protocols to receive and forward media data among connected nodes.We present a simple heuristic mechanism for the pull protocol in the selection of media segments and peers. Besides the pull method, a push method is deployed to increase the streaming quality. We know that the presence of free-riders could degrade the delivered streaming quality. In PALMS, a simple score-based incentive mechanism, similar to BitTorrent's tit-for-tat incentive mechanism, is adopted to discourage the existence of free-riders.

Computing is entering a new phase in which CPU improvements are driven by the addition of multiple cores on a single chip, rather than higher frequencies. Parallel processing on these systems is in a primitive stage, and the parallelization of a sequential B-NIDS requires the explicit use and knowledge of underlying thread architecture. In this paper the bottleneck of the thread synchronization using fine-grained lock operations is discovered, and the new synchronization mechanism with no contention for shared structures is proposed based on the characteristics of data flow. Then a pipelining programming model of multithreading system with three contexts is issued, and the differential service for streams is implemented with the multiple weighed queues. In performance evaluation, the optimized system shows much better performance in three aspects of resource utilization, throughput, and response time on 8 core server. The improved system with the proposed synchronization mechanism shows good scalability. The processing capability on tested server can exceed over 1 Gbps traffic flow.

DeHeus202131,Distributed transactions on serverless stateful functions,"Serverless computing is currently the fastest-growing cloud services segment. The most prominent serverless offering is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where users write functions and the cloud automates deployment, maintenance, and scalability. Although FaaS is a good fit for executing stateless functions, it does not adequately support stateful constructs like microservices and scalable, low-latency cloud applications, mainly because it lacks proper state management support and the ability to perform function-to-function calls. Most importantly, executing transactions across stateful functions remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce a programming model and implementation for transaction orchestration of stateful serverless functions. Our programming model supports serializable distributed transactions with two-phase commit, as well as relaxed transactional guarantees with Sagas. We design and implement our programming model on Apache Flink StateFun. We choose to build our solution on top of StateFun in order to leverage Flink's exactly-once processing and state management guarantees. We base our evaluation on the YCSB benchmark, which we extended with transactional operations and adapted for the SFaaS programming model.

Fu2020,ImRP: A Predictive Partition Method for Data Skew Alleviation in Spark Streaming Environment,"Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Spark engine that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. It treats stream as a series of deterministic batches and handles them as regular jobs. However, for a stream job responsible for a batch, data skew (i.e., the imbalance in the amount of data allocated to each reduce task), can degrade the job performance significantly because of load imbalance. In this paper, we propose an improved range partitioner (ImRP) to alleviate the reduce skew for stream jobs in Spark Streaming. Unlike previous work, ImRP does not require any pre-run sampling of input data and generates the data partition scheme based on the intermediate data distribution estimated by the previous batch processing, in which a prediction model EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) is adopted. To lighten the data skew, ImRP presents a novel method of calculating the partition borders optimally, and a mechanism of splitting the border key clusters when the semantics of shuffle operators permit. Besides, ImRP considers the integrated partition size and heterogeneity of computing environments when balancing the load among reduce tasks appropriately. We implement ImRP in Spark-3.0 and evaluate its performance on four representative benchmarks: wordCount, sort, pageRank, and LDA. The results show that by mitigating the data skew, ImRP can decrease the execution time of stream jobs substantially compared with some other partition strategies, especially when the skew degree of input batch is serious. © 2020",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Fu, Z. and Tang, Z. and Yang, L. and Li, K. and Li, K.",2020,Parallel Computing,10.1016/j.parco.2020.102699,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib

Beyond existing schemes, such as the Join the Shortest Queue (JSQ), the power of dd or the SQ(dd) and the capacity-weighted JSQ, the notion of CBS yields new application-specific policies such as hybrid locally uniform JSQ. As today's data center clusters have thousands of servers, exact analysis of CBS policies is tedious. In this article, we derive a scaling limit when the number of servers grows large, facilitating a comparison of various CBS policies with respect to their transient as well as steady state behavior. A byproduct of our derivations is the relationship between the queue filling proportions and the server buffer sizes, which cannot be obtained from infinite buffer models. Finally, we provide extensive numerical evaluations and discuss several applications including multi-stage systems. © 1990-2012 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Khudabukhsh, W.R. and Kar, S. and Alt, B. and Rizk, A. and Koeppl, H.",2020,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,10.1109/TPDS.2020.2997771,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Venugopal202051,AIR: A light-weight yet high-performance dataflow engine based on asynchronous iterative routing,"Distributed Stream Processing Engines (DSPEs) are currently among the most emerging topics in data management, with applications ranging from real-time event monitoring to processing complex dataflow programs and big data analytics. In this paper, we describe the architecture of our AIR engine, which is designed from scratch in C++ using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), pthreads for multithreading, and is directly deployed on top of a common HPC workload manager such as SLURM. AIR implements a light-weight, dynamic sharding protocol (referred to as 'Asynchronous Iterative Routing'), which facilitates a direct and asynchronous communication among all worker nodes and thereby completely avoids any additional communication overhead with a dedicated master node. With its unique design, AIR fills the gap between the prevalent scale-out (but Java-based) architectures like Apache Spark and Flink, on one hand, and recent scale-up (and C++ based) prototypes such as StreamBox and PiCo, on the other hand. Our experiments over various benchmark settings confirm that AIR performs as good as the best scale-up SPEs on a single-node setup, while it outperforms existing scale-out DSPEs in terms of processing latency and sustainable throughput by a factor of up to 15 in a distributed setting. © 2020 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,INCLUDED,INCLUDED,,,"Venugopal, V.E. and Theobald, M. and Chaychi, S. and Tawakuli, A.",2020,Proceedings - Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing,10.1109/SBAC-PAD49847.2020.00018,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Kesavan2020206,A Visual Analytics Framework for Reviewing Streaming Performance Data,"Understanding and tuning the performance of extreme-scale parallel computing systems demands a streaming approach due to the computational cost of applying offline algorithms to vast amounts of performance log data. Analyzing large streaming data is challenging because the rate of receiving data and limited time to comprehend data make it difficult for the analysts to sufficiently examine the data without missing important changes or patterns. To support streaming data analysis, we introduce a visual analytic framework comprising of three modules: data management, analysis, and interactive visualization. The data management module collects various computing and communication performance metrics from the monitored system using streaming data processing techniques and feeds the data to the other two modules. The analysis module automatically identifies important changes and patterns at the required latency. In particular, we introduce a set of online and progressive analysis methods for not only controlling the computational costs but also helping analysts better follow the critical aspects of the analysis results. Finally, the interactive visualization module provides the analysts with a coherent view of the changes and patterns in the continuously captured performance data. Through a multi-faceted case study on performance analysis of parallel discrete-event simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for identifying bottlenecks and locating outliers. © 2020 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Kesavan, S.P. and Fujiwara, T. and Li, J.K. and Ross, C. and Mubarak, M. and Carothers, C.D. and Ross, R.B. and Ma, K.-L.",2020,IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium,10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.9280,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Zhang20201537,Towards concurrent stateful stream processing on multicore processors,"Recent data stream processing systems (DSPSs) can achieve excellent performance when processing large volumes of data under tight latency constraints. However, they sacrifice support for concurrent state access that eases the burden of developing stateful stream applications. Recently, some have proposed managing concurrent state access during stream processing by modeling state accesses as transactions. However, these are realized with locks involving serious contention overhead. The coarse-grained processing paradigm adopted in these proposals magnify contention issues and does not exploit modern multicore architectures to their full potential. This paper introduces TStream, a novel DSPS supporting efficient concurrent state access on multicore processors. Transactional semantics is employed like previous work, but scalability is greatly improved due to two novel designs: 1) dual-mode scheduling, which exposes more parallelism opportunities, 2) dynamic restructuring execution, which aggressively exploits the parallelism opportunities from dual-mode scheduling without centralized lock contentions. To validate our proposal, we evaluate TStream with a benchmark of four applications on a modern multicore machine. Experimental results show that 1) TStream achieves up to 4.8 times higher throughput with similar processing latency compared to the state-of-the-art and 2) unlike prior solutions, TStream is highly tolerant of varying application workloads such as key skewness and multi-partition state accesses. © 2020 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Zhang, S. and Wu, Y. and Zhang, F. and He, B.",2020,Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering,10.1109/ICDE48307.2020.00136,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Kahveci2020205,Joker: Elastic stream processing with organic adaptation,"This paper addresses the problem of auto-parallelization of streaming applications. We propose an online parallelization optimization algorithm that adjusts the degree of pipeline and data parallelism in a joint manner. We define an operator development API and a flexible parallel execution model to form a basis for the optimization algorithm. The operator interface unifies the development of different types of operators and makes operator properties visible in order to enable safe optimizations. The parallel execution model splits a data flow graph into regions. A region contains the longest sequence of compatible operators that are amenable to data parallelism as a whole and can be further parallelized with pipeline parallelism. We also develop a stream processing run-time, named Joker, to scale the execution of streaming applications in a safe, transparent, dynamic, and automatic manner. This ability is called organic adaptation. Joker implements the runtime machinery to execute a data flow graph with any parallelization configuration and most importantly change this configuration at run-time with low cost in the presence of partitioned stateful operators, in a way that is transparent to the application developers. Joker continuously monitors the run-time performance, and runs the optimization algorithm to resolve bottlenecks and scale the application by adjusting the degree of pipeline and data parallelism. The experimental evaluation based on micro-benchmarks and real-world applications showcase that our solution accomplishes elasticity by finding an effective parallelization configuration.

Blamey2020335,"Apache spark streaming, kafka and harmonicio: a performance benchmark and architecture comparison for enterprise and scientific computing","Many scientific computing applications generate streams where message sizes exceed one megabyte, in contrast with smaller message sizes in enterprise contexts (order kilobytes, often XML or JSON). Furthermore, the processing cost of messages in scientific computing applications are usually an order of magnitude higher than in typical enterprise applications. Frameworks such as Apache Spark offer high throughput processing of streams with such ‘enterprise’ characteristics, as well as scalability, with high resilience and many other desirable features. Motivated by the development of near real-time image processing pipelines for roboticized microscopy, we evaluate the suitability of Apache Spark for streams more typical of scientific computing applications, those with large message sizes (up to 10 MB), and heavy per-message CPU load, under typical stream integrations. For comparison, we benchmark a P2P stream processing framework, HarmonicIO, developed in-house. Our study reveals a complex interplay of performance trade-offs, revealing the boundaries of good performance for each framework and integration over a wide domain of application loads. Based on these results, we suggest which are likely to offer good performance for a given load.

Maroulis20192624,A Holistic Energy-Efficient Real-Time Scheduler for Mixed Stream and Batch Processing Workloads,"In recent years we have experienced a wide adoption of novel distributed processing frameworks such as Apache Spark for handling batch and stream processing big data applications. An important aspect that has not been examined in these systems yet, is the energy consumption during the applications' execution. Reducing the energy consumption of modern datacenters is a necessity, as datacenters contribute over 2 percent of the total US electric usage. However, efficiently scheduling applications in distributed processing systems can be challenging as there is a trade-off between minimizing the datacenter's energy usage and satisfying the application performance requirements. In this work we propose, ExpREsS, a scheduler for orchestrating the execution of Spark applications in a way that enables us to minimize the energy consumption while ensuring that the applications' performance requirements are met. Our approach exploits time-series segmentation for capturing the applications' energy usage and execution times, and then applies a novel DVFS technique to minimize the energy consumption. In order to tackle the limited number of application's profiling runs, we exploit regression techniques to predict the applications' execution times and power consumption.

López-Gómez201924,Exploring stream parallel patterns in distributed MPI environments,"In recent years, the large volumes of stream data and the near real-time requirements of data streaming applications have exacerbated the need for new scalable algorithms and programming interfaces for distributed and shared-memory platforms. To contribute in this direction, this paper presents a new distributed MPI back end for GRPPI, a C++ high-level generic interface of data-intensive and stream processing parallel patterns. This back end, as a new execution policy, supports distributed and hybrid (distributed+shared-memory) parallel executions of the Pipeline and Farm patterns, where the hybrid mode combines the MPI policy with a GRPPI shared-memory one. These patterns internally leverage distributed queues, which can be configured to use two-sided or one-sided MPI primitives to communicate items among nodes. A detailed analysis of the GOP! MPI execution policy reports considerable benefits from the programmability, flexibility and readability points of view. The experimental evaluation of two different streaming applications with different distributed and shared-memory scenarios reports considerable performance gains with respect to the sequential versions at the expense of negligible GRPPI overheads.

The main idea is that brokers individually invoke the query on their received messages and forward the top-k results to a stream processing operator that performs the merging of the results and provides to the end-user the final top-k results. Moreover, our system exploits the Bayesian Optimization technique to determine automatically the number of top-k results that should be provided by each broker. Our approach has been developed in the Kappa architecture that exploits topic-based scalable publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems like Apache Kafka to efficiently forward the high volume of incoming messages to distributed processing systems (i.e., Apache Spark or Apache Flink) that perform the batch and stream analytics operations.

TurrisidaCosta20193,Evaluating the Four-Way Performance Trade-Off for Stream Classification,"Machine Learning (ML) solutions need to deal efficiently with a huge amount of data available, addressing scalability concerns without sacrificing predictive performance. Moreover, this data comes in the form of a continuous and evolving stream imposing new constraints, e.g., limited memory and energy resources. In the same way, energy-aware ML algorithms are gaining relevance due to the power constraints of hardware platforms in several real-life applications, as the Internet of Things (IoT). Many algorithms have been proposed to cope with the mutable nature of data streams, with the Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) being one of the most widely used. An adaptation of the VFDT, called Strict VFDT (SVFDT), can significantly reduce memory usage without putting aside the predictive performance and time efficiency. However, the analysis of energy consumption regarding data stream processing of the VFDT and SVFDT is overlooked. In this work, we compare the four-way relationship between predictive performance, memory costs, time efficiency and energy consumption, tuning the hyperparameters of the algorithms to optimise the resources devoted to it. Experiments over 23 benchmark datasets revealed that the SVFDT-I is the most energy-friendly algorithm and greatly reduced memory consumption, being statistically superior to the VFDT. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Costa, V.G. and Santana, E.J. and Lopes, J.F. and Barbon, Jr.",2019,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10.1007/978-3-030-19223-5_1,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib
Chauvin2019,"Efficiency, economics and compliance: A practical planning tool for optimizing cuttings treatment","The expanding focus on total cost of ownership (TCO) in the oilfield is driving the application of global best practices in drilling and completion operations. Measurable benefits can result from a proactive approach to separating, treating, and handling disposal streams that accounts for both short- and long-term effects and is tailored to the specific needs of projects in the Middle East. This paper provides a versatile decision-making tool to help determine the optimal processes for a variety of conditions based on efficiency, economics, and sustainability. The most effective treatment solutions and services seek to address multiple factors, including logistics and expenses, drilling efficiency and performance, remote locations with infrastructure limitations, and strict environmental regulations. Interdependencies between the fluids, equipment, and services will also influence the selection of appropriate separation and treatment processes. A useful decision tree is based on the critical goals of waste volume reduction and maximum recovery of valuable components. Making the right choices in both of these areas will provide effective long-term results and economic benefits. This paper summarizes multiple case histories that demonstrate successful cuttings and waste stream processing, including both land and offshore operations. In some cases, a mobile or well-specific treatment system works best; others rely on a central treatment facility to serve an entire field or multirig operation. The results achieved in each case contribute to a step-by-step planning tool in matrix format that can be used to design the best set of equipment and services for each location. The matrix accounts for many factors, including rig equipment and capacities, proposed drilling and completion fluids, lithology, risk assessment, system maintenance, potential process rates and throughput, mobilization, environmental regulations, and infrastructure requirements. The decision tree presented facilitates the treatment selection process by incorporating useful benchmarks for volumes, process rates, expected base oil/fluid recovery, installation costs/requirements, scalability, longevity, and decommissioning (and/or relocation of the treatment system). It provides a practical starting point for planning an efficient, fit-for-purpose treatment configuration, scaled to match operational needs, reduce total cost of ownership, and meet or exceed existing and future standards. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Chauvin, and E.,",2019,"Society of Petroleum Engineers - Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2018, ADIPEC 2018",,scopus-search1.bib

Additionally, we address the issue of defining time in distributed systems by capturing time on one machine and defining the baseline latency. We validate our benchmark for Apache Flink using a processing pipeline comprising common stream processing operations.

Bilal201816,Mitigating network side channel leakage for stream processing systems in trusted execution environments,"A crucial concern regarding cloud computing is the confidentiality of sensitive data being processed in the cloud. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX), allow applications to run securely on an untrusted platform. However, using TEEs alone for stream processing is not enough to ensure privacy as network communication patterns may leak information about the data. This paper introduces two techniques - anycast and multicast - for mitigating leakage at inter-stage communications in streaming applications according to a user-selected mitigation level. These techniques aim to achieve network data obliviousness, i.e., communication patterns should not depend on the data. We implement these techniques in an SGX-based stream processing system. We evaluate the latency and throughput overheads, and the data obliviousness using three benchmark applications. The results show that anycast scales better with input load and mitigation level, and provides better data obliviousness than multicast. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Bilal, M. and Alsibyani, H. and Canini, M.",2018,DEBS 2018 - Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-Based Systems,10.1145/3210284.3210286,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;acm1-search1.bib
Mahapatra201841,Designing flink pipelines in IoT mashup tools,"Internet of Things (IoT) applications are generating increasingly large amounts of data because of continuous activity and periodical sensing capabilities.

State-of-the-art stream-processing platforms, such as Apache Flink, can be used to process large amounts of data streams from different IoT devices. However, it is difficult to both set-up and write applications for these platforms; this is also manifested in the increasing need for data analysts and engineers. A promising solution is to enable domain experts, who are not necessarily programmers, to develop the necessary stream pipelines by providing them with domain-specific graphical tools.

Chakraborty2016,A priority based resource scheduling technique for multitenant storm clusters,"In this work in progress paper, we present our ongoing effort towards devising a priority based resource scheduling technique and framework for apache storm. Apache Storm is a popular distributed real time stream processing engine which has been widely adopted by key players in the industry including YAHOO and Twitter. An application running in storm is called a topology that is characterized by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). To run multiple of such topologies in a storm cluster, storm provides with default, out of the box scheduler called Isolation Scheduler. Isolation Scheduler assigns resources to topologies based on static resource configuration and does not provide any means to prioritize topologies based on their varying business priority. As a result, performance degradation, even complete starvation of topologies with high business priority is possible when available cluster resources are insufficient. A priority based resource scheduling strategy is proposed in this paper to overcome this problem. A preliminary performance evaluation is performed to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed scheduler over the default storm Isolation Scheduler. © 2016 The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Chakraborty, R. and Majumdar, S.",2016,"Proceedings of the 2016 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems, SPECTS 2016 - Part of SummerSim 2016 Multiconference",10.1109/SPECTS.2016.7570513,scopus-search1.bib;ieee1-search1.bib
Coluccio2014,Online stream processing of machine-to-machine communications traffic: A platform comparison,"In a machine-to-machine (M2M) communications system, the deployed devices relay data from on-board sensors to a back-end application over a wireless network. Since the cellular network provides very good coverage (especially in inhabited areas) and is relatively inexpensive, commercial M2M applications often prefer it to other technologies such as WiFi or satellite links. Unfortunately, having been originally designed with human users in mind, the cellular network provides little support to monitor millions of unattended devices. For this reason, it is extremely important to monitor the underlying signalling traffic to detect misbehaving devices or network problems. In the cellular network used by M2M communications systems, the network elements communicate using the Signalling System #7 (SS7), and a real-life system can generate tens of millions of SS7 messages per hour. This paper reports the results of our practical investigation on the possibility to use distributed stream processing systems (DSPSs) to perform real-time analysis of SS7 traffic in a commercial M2M communications system consisting of hundreds of thousands of devices. Through a thorough experimental evaluation based on the analysis of real-world SS7 traces, we present and compare the implementations of a DSPS-based data analysis application on top of either the well-known Storm DSPS or the Quasit middleware.

Kotevski2014410,Hybrid fluid modeling approach for performance analysis of P2P live video streaming systems,"In this paper a hybrid modeling approach with different modeling formalisms and solution methods is employed in order to analyze the performance of peer to peer live video streaming systems. We conjointly use queuing networks and Fluid Stochastic Petri Nets, developing several performance models to analyze the behavior of rather complex systems. The models account for: network topology, peer churn, scalability, peer average group size, peer upload bandwidth heterogeneity and video buffering, while introducing several features unconsidered in previous performance models, such as: admission control for lower contributing peers, control traffic overhead and internet traffic packet loss. Our analytical and simulation results disclose the optimum number of peers in a neighborhood, the minimum required server upload bandwidth, the optimal buffer size and the influence of control traffic overhead. The analysis reveals the existence of a performance switch-point (i.e. threshold) up to which system scaling is beneficial, whereas performance steeply decreases thereafter. Several degrees of degraded service are introduced to explore performance with arbitrary percentage of lost video frames and provide support for protocols that use scalable video coding techniques. We also find that implementation of admission control does not improve performance and may discourage new peers if waiting times for joining the system increase. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Kotevski, Z. and Mitrevski, P.",2014,Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications,10.1007/s12083-013-0205-7,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib
Lai2014119,CSense: A stream-processing toolkit for robust and high-rate mobile sensing applications,"This paper presents CSense - a stream-processing toolkit for developing robust and high-rate mobile sensing application in Java. CSense addresses the needs of these systems by providing a new programming model that supports flexible application configuration, a high-level concurrency model, memory management, and compiler analyses and optimizations. Our compiler includes a novel flow analysis that optimizes the exchange of data across components from an application-wide perspective. A mobile sensing application benchmark indicates that flow analysis may reduce CPU utilization by as much as 45%. Static analysis is used to detect a range of programming errors including application composition errors, improper use of memory management, and data races. We identify that memory management and concurrency limit the scalability of stream processing systems. We incorporate memory pools, frame conversion optimizations, and custom synchronization primitives to develop a scalable run-time. CSense is evaluated on Galaxy Nexus phones running Android. Empirical results indicate that our run-time achieves 19 times higher steam processing rate compared to a realistic baseline implementation. We demonstrate the versatility of CSense by developing three mobile sensing applications. © 2014 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Lai, F. and Hasan, S.S. and Laugesen, A. and Chipara, O.",2014,IPSN 2014 - Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (Part of CPS Week),10.1109/IPSN.2014.6846746,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee1-search1.bib;acm2-search1.bib
Maamar201281,A multihop supplying partner protocol for 3D streaming systems over thin mobile devices,"The recent advances in technology and mobile computing led to the rapid growth of networked 3D streaming applications. Due to the limited network bandwidth of the client server approach, research works are now turning toward mobile ad- hoc networks (MANET)-based streaming. MANET-based streaming is considered challenging due to the limitation of the wireless medium. Moreover, given that the 3D data is distributed among peers, finding a suitable supplying part- ner is not considered an easy task.

It builds on the concept of stream processing to structure dynamically evolving networks of communicating asynchronous components. These components themselves are implemented using a conventional language suitable for the application domain. Our goal is to map Distributed S-NET to the Intel SCC processor in order to provide users with a simplified programming environment, yet still allowing them to make use of the advanced features of the SCC architecture. Following a brief introduction to the design principles of S-NET, we sketch out the general ideas of our implementation approach. These mainly concern the use of SCC's message passing buffers for lightweight communication of S-NET records and control data between cores as well as remapping of large data structures through lookup table manipulation.

It's a peer to peer network of logically connected clients which form an application level overlay network on top of the physical network. This new paradigm brings numerous advantages, but also a lot of open issues that need to be resolved.

Liu2009161,A decentralized control mechanism for stream processing networks,"Data streaming applications are becoming more and more common due to the rapid development in emerging areas such as sensor networks, multimedia streaming, and on-line data mining, etc. These applications are often running in a decentralized, distributed environment. The requirements for processing large volumes of streaming data at real time have posed many great design challenges. One of the critical issues is to optimize the ongoing resource consumption of multiple, distributed, cooperating processing units. In this paper, we consider a generic model for the general stream data processing systems. We address the resource allocation problem for a collection of processing units so as to maximize the weighted sum of the throughput of different streams. Each processing unit may require multiple input data streams simultaneously and produce one or many valuable output streams.

Singh20221585,A data structure perspective to the RDD-based Apriori algorithm on Spark,"During the recent years, a number of efficient and scalable frequent itemset mining algorithms for big data analytics have been proposed by many researchers. Initially, MapReduce-based frequent itemset mining algorithms on Hadoop cluster were proposed. Although, Hadoop has been developed as a cluster computing system for handling and processing big data, but the performance of Hadoop does not meet the expectation for the iterative algorithms of data mining, due to its high I/O, and writing and then reading intermediate results in the disk. Consequently, Spark has been developed as another cluster computing infrastructure which is much faster than Hadoop due to its in-memory computation. It is highly suitable for iterative algorithms and supports batch, interactive, iterative, and stream processing of data. Many frequent itemset mining algorithms have been re-designed on the Spark, and most of them are Apriori-based. All these Spark-based Apriori algorithms use Hash Tree as the underlying data structure. This paper investigates the efficiency of various data structures for the Spark-based Apriori. Although, the data structure perspective has been investigated previously, but for the MapReduce-based Apriori, and it must be re-investigated in the distributed computing environment of Spark. The considered underlying data structures are Hash Tree, Trie, and Hash Table Trie. The experimental results on the benchmark datasets show that the performance of Spark-based Apriori with Trie and Hash Table Trie are almost similar but both perform many times better than Hash Tree in the distributed computing environment of Spark. © 2019, Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Singh, P. and Singh, S. and Mishra, P.K. and Garg, R.",2022,International Journal of Information Technology (Singapore),10.1007/s41870-019-00337-3,scopus-search1.bib
Farrokh2022,SP-ant: An ant colony optimization based operator scheduler for high performance distributed stream processing on heterogeneous clusters,"A key feature of distributed stream processing (DSP) systems is the scheduling of operators on clustered computers. In scheduling, the assignment plan of operators to nodes of the cluster, requirements of operators, and the computational power of each worker node must be considered with the goal of finding a tradeoff between the communication latency of operators and the utilization of worker nodes to minimize the overall system response time. To reach this goal is quite challenging, especially in heterogeneous clusters, because there are no accurate estimations about the loads of worker nodes at run time. To address this challenge, we propose a novel stream processing scheduling using ant colony algorithm (SP-Ant). SP-Ant finds the best operator assignment plan considering the inter-node communication latencies of operators by initially collocating highly communicative operators on the same worker nodes using the bin-packing algorithm and iteratively (re-)scheduling only the less communicative operators using the exploration and exploitation phases of the evolutionary ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm in order to reduce its convergence time. SP-Ant is implemented on the standard Apache Storm. Using several standard benchmark topologies of Storm, it is shown that SP-Ant outperforms the R-Storm and Storm default schedulers by at least 50% in reducing the response time. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Farrokh, M. and Hadian, H. and Sharifi, M. and Jafari, A.",2022,Expert Systems with Applications,10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116322,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib
Zhang2021671,RDMA-Based Apache Storm for High-Performance Stream Data Processing,"Apache Storm is a scalable fault-tolerant distributed real time stream-processing framework widely used in big data applications. For distributed data-sensitive applications, low-latency, high-throughput communication modules have a critical impact on overall system performance. Apache Storm currently uses Netty as its communication component, an asynchronous server/client framework based on TCP/IP protocol stack. The TCP/IP protocol stack has inherent performance flaws due to frequent memory copying and context switching. The Netty component not only limits the performance of the Storm but also increases the CPU load in the IPoIB (IP over InfiniBand) communication mode. In this paper, we introduce two new implementations for Apache Storm communication components with the help of RDMA technology. The performance evaluation on Mellanox QDR Cards (40 Gbps) shows that our implementations can achieve speedup up to 5× compared with IPoIB and 10× with Gigabit Ethernet.

Marić2021148,DEBS grand challenge: Real-time detection of air quality improvement with Apache Flink,"The topic of the DEBS Grand Challenge 2021 is to develop a solution for detecting areas in which the air quality index (AQI) improved the most when compared to the previous year. The solution must run two given continuous queries in parallel on the incoming sensor data stream which must return the following: 1) a top 50 cities in terms of AQI improvement with their current AQIs and 2) a histogram of the longest streaks of good AQI. The incoming data is accessed through an API which provides streaming sensor measurements in batches. We present our solution based on Apache Flink, a distributed stream processing framework for the cluster. We opted for Flink since its applications can easily be scaled horizontally and vertically by adding computation nodes or increasing available resources, respectively. Flink allows us to divide the given queries into smaller tasks which can be run concurrently on different nodes in order to reduce the overall processing time and thus improve the performance of our solution. In more detail, the following performance intensive tasks are run in parallel on distributed nodes: 1) retrieving measurement batches, 2) assigning a city to each measurement and 3) calculating air quality index per city.

Mostafaei2021820,SNR: Network-aware geo-distributed stream analytics,"Emerging applications such as those running on the Internet of Things (IoT) devices produce constant data streams that need to be processed in real-time. Distributed stream processing systems (DSPs), with geographically distributed cluster networks interconnected via wide area network (WAN) links, have recently gained interest in handling these applications. How-ever, these applications have stringent requirements such as low-latency and high bandwidth that must be guaranteed to ensure the quality of service (QoS). These application requirements raise fundamental DSPs resource management and scheduling challenge. In this paper, we formulate the problem of placement of worker nodes on a geo-distributed DSPs cluster network as a multi-criteria decision-making problem and propose an additive weighting-based approach to solve it. The proposed solution finds the trade-off among different network parameters and allows executing the tasks according to the desired performance metrics. We evaluated the proposed approach using the Yahoo! streaming benchmark on a testbed and compare it against mechanisms deployed in Apache Spark, Apache Storm, and Apache Flink. The results of the evaluation show that our approach improves the performance of Spark up to 2.2x-7.2x, Storm up to 1.2x-3.4x, and Flink up to 1.4x-3.3x compared to other approaches, which makes our approach useful for use in practical environments. © 2021 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Mostafaei, H. and Afridi, S. and Abawajy, J.H.",2021,"Proceedings - 21st IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing, CCGrid 2021",10.1109/CCGrid51090.2021.00100,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Ndubuaku2019164,Cloud-assisted adaptive stream processing from discriminative representations,"As the streaming data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) ubiquitous sensors grow in massive scale, extracting interesting information (anomalies) in real-time becomes more challenging. Traditional systems which retrospectively perform all the processing in the cloud do not capture real-time changes in the data. Similarly, real-time solutions which rely on human monitors have the tendency to miss the anomalies due to their rare nature. In recent times, several machine learning techniques have been proposed for stream processing. Approaches based on supervised or semi-supervised learning fail to adapt to changing patterns of the streaming data and the data labelling costs are huge. To address these limitations, we propose a cloud-assisted framework where an intermediary node (edge) is introduced between the end devices and the cloud to assist in stream processing. A model deployed on the edge is designed to learn in an iterative manner to discriminate between similar and dissimilar data representations, making it easier to distinguish the anomalies. In this work, we have proposed an iterative method that combines the capabilities of deep clustering and l2-normalisation to achieve better discriminative representations. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves robust performance over state-of-the-art discriminative representation algorithms and sets new benchmark accuracy on transformation invariant image dataset. © 2019 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Ndubuaku, M. and Anjum, A. and Liotta, A.",2019,"Conference Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics",10.1109/SMC.2019.8914227,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Wang2019,A network-aware and partition-based resource management scheme for data stream processing,"With the increasing demand for data-driven decision making, there is an urgent need for processing geographically distributed data streams in real-time. The existing scheduling and resource management schemes efficiently optimize stream processing performance with the awareness of resource, quality-of-service, and network traffic. However, the correlation between network delay and inter-operator communication pattern is not well-understood. In this study, we propose a network-aware and partition-based resource management scheme to deal with the ever-changing network condition and data communication in stream processing. The proposed approach applies operator fusion by considering the computational demand of individual operators and the inter-operator communication patterns. It maps the fused operators to the clustered hosts with the weighted shortest processing time heuristic. Meanwhile, we established a 3-dimensional coordinate system for prompt reflection of the network condition, real-time traffic, and resource availability. We evaluated the proposed approach against two benchmarks, and the results demonstrate the efficiency in throughput and resource utilization. We also conducted a case study and implemented a prototype system supported by the proposed approach that aims to utilize the stream processing paradigm for pedestrian behavior analysis. The prototype application estimates walking time for a given path according to the real crowd traffic. The promising evaluation results of processing performance further illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2019 ACM.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Wang, Y. and Tari, Z. and Huang, X. and Zomaya, A.Y.",2019,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,10.1145/3337821.3337870,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;acm1-search1.bib
Schelter201961,Efficient incremental cooccurrence analysis for item-based collaborative filtering,"Recommender systems are ubiquitous in the modern internet, where they help users find items they might like. A widely deployed recommendation approach is item-based collaborative filtering. This approach relies on analyzing large item cooccurrence matrices that denote how many users interacted with a pair of items. The potentially quadratic number of items to compare poses a scalability bottleneck in analyzing such item cooccurrences. Additionally, this problem intensifies in real world use cases with incrementally growing datasets, especially when the recommendation model is regularly recomputed from scratch. We highlight the connection between the growing cost of item-based recommendation and densification processes in common interaction datasets. Based on our findings, we propose an efficient incremental algorithm for item-based collaborative filtering based on cooccurrence analysis. This approach restricts the number of interactions to consider from ‘power users’ and ‘ubiquitous items’ to guarantee a provably constant amount of work per user-item interaction to process. We discuss efficient implementations of our algorithm on a single machine as well as on a distributed stream processing engine, and present an extensive experimental evaluation. Our results confirm the asymptotic benefits of the incremental approach. Furthermore, we find that our implementation is an order of magnitude faster than existing open source recommender libraries on many datasets, and at the same time scales to high dimensional datasets which these existing recommenders fail to process. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Minallah2019387,Performance Comparison of Chunk/Peer Scheduling Algorithms of Peer-to-Peer Streaming Systems,"In a P2P system, the media stream is divided into small data units known as chunks. Each peer in a P2P system has to take two important decisions at a given time i.e. how the chunks are to be shared? (chunk scheduling) and with which peer are they to be shared with (peer scheduling). Scheduling plays an important role in evaluating performance of P2P systems. This paper compares the performance of different combinations of chunk/peer schedulers in terms of chunk diffusion delay, average chunk distribution delay and max chunk distribution delay. The results obtained under the specified experimental setup show that when Deadline Based chunk scheduling(DLc) is combined with different peer scheduling algorithms, the best results are obtained by its combination with Chunk Earliest Free Peer Scheduler (CEFp). For a constant peer scheduler CEFp combined with different chunk schedulers, the best results are obtained by combining it with Lastest Blind Chunk Scheduler (LBc).

Weibbach201965,Live traffic data analysis using stream processing,"The increasing digitalization in the traffic infrastructure offers a great potential to optimize traffic flows, to save costs, and to improve the CO2 balance. Achieving this requires the use of scalable, high-performance software environments that process live traffic data with minimal latency. However, there are no standard solutions that work out of the box. Instead, technology stacks of complex components must be assembled, configured, and deployed from a large and heterogeneous set of available building blocks. Since there are no guidelines on which particular software to use in which configuration for specific use cases, it is extremely difficult to build such complex architectures from scratch. Nevertheless, many application areas, including traffic data analysis, have domain-specific requirements, which makes it possible to close these gaps on the basis of further research. Following this idea, we analyze how typical applications of traffic data analysis can be implemented using stream processing technologies in order to find reusable solutions that can be used as blueprints for the design of applications with similar requirements. Therefore, a number of typical use cases will be analyzed, implemented and benchmarked on the basis of various stream processing architectures.

Multiple experiments on Amazon EC2 indicate that the proposed approach for Homomorphic encryption provides significant results which is 10% to 17% improvement of average latency in the case of email filter benchmark and EDGAR benchmarks respectively.

Li20182193,Burstiness-Aware Elastic Resource Allocation in Stream Data Processing [流数据处理中负载突发感知的弹性资源分配],"In distributed parallel data stream processing, facing the real-time-changing and bursting stream data, fixed resource allocation will cause waste of resources or reduce the quality of service. To achieve desirable performances without resource wastes, the scalable and elastic resource allocation is a critical problem to be solved, which allows applications to change dynamically their resource configuration in response to data load fluctuations at run-time. However, most elastic resource allocation policies only adjust their resources when the performance of nodes does not match the data load. The adjustment delay caused by the immediate resource allocation, and the unpredictable data load reduce the performance of the elastic allocation policy. In some work, the data load prediction is introduced into the elastic resource allocation, but in the data prediction model, the future data is predicted based on the historical data, which is not applicable to the bursty stream data. Moreover, the unnecessary resource adjustment bump increases the system overhead. This paper focuses on the adjustment delay and the adjustment jump in the elastic resource allocation. For the above problems, the main challenge lies in the prediction of burst load and the cooperation among nodes. Therefore, this paper firstly constructs a data load correlation model to predict the data load of nodes accurately. This model considers the correlation between nodes of the stream application, that is the node will experience the sudden load change, once its upstream nodes have carried out resource adjustments, then uses the queuing theory to predict the data load of the node in the next window, according to the states of its neighborhood upstream nodes in the current window, which includes the data load, the buffer occupy, the processing ability and the consumption ratio. Furthermore, a bi-directional control mechanism is designed to support the cooperative resource allocation between the upstream and downstream nodes, in which the feed forward control transmits the information of upstream nodes to downstream nodes, and the feedback control transmits the information inversely and selects the appropriate upstream nodes to participate in the resource allocation of the downstream nodes. Based on the data load correlation model and the bi-directional control mechanism, this paper proposes an upstream-downstream cooperative and elastic resource allocation strategy, optimizing for data quality and resource utilization rate quality of service (QoS) requirements and considering the adjustment cost. In this strategy, the downstream node can timely detect the sudden load and load variation trend produced by the upstream nodes, and thus the resource adjustment will be done in advance, and the adjustment bump can also be avoided. At the same time, according to the feedback mechanism, the upstream nodes can dynamically adjust the data processing rate to suppress the load fluctuation of the downstream node, aimed at reducing the possibility of resource adjustment. Experimental results show that, the strategy is effective, compared with two benchmark strategies used in similar scenarios. When the load change is large, the strategy can reduce the average data loss by 85%, and significantly reduce the overhead of system resource adjustment, and improves the resource utilization. © 2018, Science Press.

Sajjad201833,Optimizing windowed aggregation over geo-distributed data streams,"Real-time data analytics is essential since more and more applications require online decision making in a timely manner. However, efficient analysis of geo-distributed data streams is challenging. This is because data needs to be collected from all edge data centers, which aggregate data from local sources, in order to process most of the analytic tasks. Thus, most of the time edge data centers need to transfer data to a central data center over a wide area network, which is expensive. In this paper, we advocate for a coordinated approach of edge data centers in order to handle these analytic tasks efficiently and hence, reducing the communication cost among data centers. We focus on the windowed aggregation of data streams, which has been widely used in stream analytics. In general, aggregation of data streams among edge data centers in the same region reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent over cross-region communication links. Based on state-of-the-art research, we leverage intra-region links and design a low-overhead coordination algorithm that optimizes communication cost for data aggregation. Our algorithm has been evaluated using synthetic and Big Data Benchmark datasets. The evaluation results show that our algorithm reduces the bandwidth cost up to ~6x, as compared to the state-of-the-art solution. © 2018 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Sajjad, H.P. and Liu, Y. and Vlassov, V.",2018,"Proceedings - 2018 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing, EDGE 2018 - Part of the 2018 IEEE World Congress on Services",10.1109/EDGE.2018.00012,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib
Muñoz2018,Supporting MPI-distributed stream parallel patterns in GrPPI,"In the recent years, the large volumes of stream data and the near real-time requirements of data streaming applications have exacerbated the need for new scalable algorithms and programming interfaces for distributed and shared-memory platforms. To contribute in this direction, this paper presents a new distributed MPI back end for GrPPI, a C++ high-level generic interface of data-intensive and stream processing parallel patterns.

Tran2018278,Reducing tail latencies while improving resiliency to timing errors for stream processing workloads,"Stream processing is an increasingly popular model for online data processing that can be partitioned into streams of elements. It is commonly used in real-time data analytics services, such as processing Twitter tweets and Internet of Things (IoT) device feeds. Current stream processing frameworks boast high throughput and low average latency. However, users of these frameworks may desire lower tail latencies and better real-time performance for their applications. In practice, there are a number of errors that can affect the performance of stream processing applications, such as garbage collection and resource contention. For some applications, these errors may cause unacceptable violations of real-time constraints. In this paper we propose applying redundancy in the data processing pipeline to increase the resiliency of stream processing applications to timing errors. This results in better real-time performance and a reduction in tail latency. We present a methodology and apply this redundancy in a framework based on Twitter's Heron. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of this technique against a range of injected timing errors using benchmarks from Intel's Storm Benchmark. Our results show that redundant tuple processing can effectively reduce the tail latency, and that the number of missed deadlines can also be reduced by up to 94% in the best case. We also study the potential effects of duplication when applied at different stages in the topology. For the topologies in this paper, we further observe that duplication is most effective when computation is redundant at the first bolt. Finally, we evaluate the additional overhead that duplicating tuples brings to a stream processing topology. Our results also show that computation overhead scales slower than communication, and that the real-time performance is improved in spite of the overheads. Overall we conclude that redundancy through duplicated tuples is indeed a powerful tool for increasing the resiliency to intermittent runtime timing errors. ©2018 IEEE",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Tran, G.P.C. and Walters, J.P. and Crago, S.P.",2018,"Proceedings - 2018 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing, SCC 2018 - Part of the 2018 IEEE World Congress on Services",10.1109/SCC.2018.00048,scopus-search1.bib;scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Wang2018215,Model-Based Scheduling for Stream Processing Systems,"Stream processing is emerging to react to the changing business situations of real-time processing. The main aim of this paradigm is to deal with the huge volume of data in the format of information flows originating from distributed devices. This consequently poses challenges to the scheduling problem in cloud data centers regarding the time-varying velocity of data ingesting and processing. In response to the uncertainties and complexities of streaming data, we propose a model-based scheduling scheme for stream processing systems, capturing the system behavior and providing an optimal allocation strategy to adapt to the changing work conditions. The proposed scheduling policy is implemented in Apache Storm, and micro-benchmarks with various shapes (e.g line, star, and diamond) were used in the evaluation. A topology that tracks trending topics on Twitter is also used, where the input is feeding with tweets in real-time. Experimental results show that the proposed solution can perform estimations that are well aligned with the system performance. The proposed scheduling policy achieves an improved performance with regards throughput and latency under varying ingesting rates. © 2017 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Wang, Y. and Tari, Z. and Farahabady, M.R.H. and Zomaya, A.Y.",2017,"Proceedings - 2017 IEEE 19th Intl Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications, HPCC 2017, 2017 IEEE 15th Intl Conference on Smart City, SmartCity 2017 and 2017 IEEE 3rd Intl Conference on Data Science and Systems, DSS 2017",10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2017.28,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib

In this paper, we propose a new architecture for such a car information system based on a smart data streaming infrastructure. This architecture has been implemented and we have run several experiments to examine the quality of our proposed solution.

This paper presents an energy efficient FPGA acceleration architecture of a particle filter, which is based on stream processing structure with a parallel resampling algorithm. Particle filters solve the state estimation problems with three steps: prediction, likelihood calculation and resampling. By accomplishing the resampling in a valid pixel area of an input image frame, while executing prediction in a synchronization region, our approach achieves real-time object tracking. This paper mainly highlights implementation alternatives using different clock frequencies and resource usages of FPGA.

It achieves agility and controls for Development and IT Operations teams to build, ship, and run any app, anywhere. Taking Docker's advantages, enterprises are able to leverage big data analytics more efficiently. In this paper, we use two network modes in Docker when building one Spark based streaming application. To get better achievement we design one experimental system to investigate performance between host and overlay network mode from different aspects. Through our working, we find host mode is faster overlay mode around 8%. At the same time, the overlay mode is more stable. We introduce coefficient of variation to see the difference of transfer latency among every package and overlay mode is better than host mode more than 50%. Therefore, overlay network mode is more suitable for the business with high quality requirement of network jitter like video conference.

Roodaki2017,Scalable multiview video coding for immersive video streaming systems,"Immersive video places the user inside the video scene, allowing the user to control the direction of the view. To achieve this, the view of every direction must be recorded using either a panoramic camera or multiple cameras placed at different positions with different angels. The size of the captured video can be quite large due to multiple video streams, one from each camera. Even with compression standards such as Multiview Video Coding (MVC), the transmission of the whole MVC video is still bandwidth-costly, especially for heterogeneous users whose bandwidths vary. In this paper, we present a new approach for immersive video streaming by using Scalable Multiview Video Coding (SMVC) to create multiple layers of the immersive video, supporting heterogeneous receivers more efficiently. Our method limits the number of views in its base layer, while it uses view scalability and free view-point scalability in the additional layers to synthesize more views at the receiver and provide high quality free view-point viewing to the user. Performance evaluations demonstrate that our method: 1-synthesizes missing views more accurately, as evident subjectively, and 2-achieves an average and maximum gain of 0.75 and 1.4 in Bjontegaard BD-Bitrate scale, respectively, compared to existing work which simply group adjacent views in the same layer. © 2016 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Roodaki, H. and Shirmohammadi, S.",2017,VCIP 2016 - 30th Anniversary of Visual Communication and Image Processing,10.1109/VCIP.2016.7805454,scopus-search1.bib

Karavadara2016,Dynamic power management for reactive stream processing on the SCC tiled architecture,"Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is a means to adjust the computing capacity and power consumption of computing systems to the application demands. DVFS is generally useful to provide a compromise between computing demands and power consumption, especially in the areas of resource-constrained computing systems. Many modern processors support some form of DVFS. In this article, we focus on the development of an execution framework that provides lightweight DVFS support for reactive stream processing systems (RSPS). RSPs are a common form of embedded control systems, operating in direct response to inputs from their environment. At the execution framework, we focus on support for many-core scheduling for parallel execution of concurrent programs. We provide a DVFS strategy for RSPs that is simple and lightweight, to be used for dynamic adaptation of the power consumption at runtime. The simplicity of the DVFS strategy became possible by the sole focus on the application domain of RSPs. The presented DVFS strategy does not require specific assumptions about the message arrival rate or the underlying scheduling method. While DVFS is a very active field, in contrast to most existing research, our approach works also for platforms like many-core processors, where the power settings typically cannot be controlled individually for each computational unit. We also support dynamic scheduling with variable workload. While many research results are provided with simulators, in our approach, we present a parallel execution framework with experiments conducted on real hardware, using the single-chip cloud computer many-core processor. The results of our experimental evaluation confirm that our simple DVFS strategy provides potential for significant energy saving on RSPs. © 2016, Karavadara et al.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Karavadara, N. and Zolda, M. and NgaNguyen, V.T. and Knoop, J. and Kirner, R.",2016,Eurasip Journal on Embedded Systems,10.1186/s13639-016-0035-9,scopus-search1.bib
Algemili2016226,Investigation of Reconfigurable FPGA Design for Processing Big Data Streams,"Big Data situation has placed a tremendous pressure on the existing computational models. The challenges of Big Data call for a new approach to solve both software and hardware problems. Streaming applications is a form of on-demand software distribution. In streaming scenarios, only essential portions of an application's code need to be installed on the system, while the receiver performs the main operations. The necessary code and files are delivered over the network as, and when, they are required. The hardware architecture plays an important role in improving the efficiency of a streaming system. The variance of hardware performance on different HW architectures is quite interesting. Previous work confirms that the CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs are performing differently on specific applications. The previous efforts of hardware benchmarking show that GPUs outperformed the other platforms in terms of execution time. CPUs outperformed in overall execution combined with transfer time. FPGAs outperformed for fixed algorithms using streaming [1]. Hence, this paper evaluates the performance of streaming applications on a pipelined FPGA design. In the context of real-time processing, it elects one of the Big Data streaming problems that gets a candidate for majority element on-the-fly, that is Moore's Voting Algorithm.

The SCU is intended for streaming applications with real-time event and data processing that have stricter deadlines, high-bandwidth, and high-accuracy requirements. To meet these requirements, the SCU exploits unique characteristics of DSMSs, such as single-pass tuple processing, windowed operators, and inherent data level parallelism, using a single-instruction multiple-data very large instruction word (SIMD-VLIW) microarchitecture and a novel inverted distributed register file. In order to better explain the instruction set, design, and functionality of the various units in the SCU, this paper also provides a brief overview of SymQL-a procedural query language that we developed to describe the queries that can be executed on the SCU. Finally, this paper presents the performance of SCU using four queries that represent common data stream processing use-cases, one of them being similar to a query found in the Linear Road Benchmark.

Chen20152371,Distinct element counting in distributed dynamic data streams,"We consider a new type of distinct element counting problem in dynamic data streams, where (1) insertions and deletions of an element can appear not only in the same data stream but also in two or more different streams, (2) a deletion of a distinct element cancels out all the previous insertions of this element, and (3) a distinct element can be re-inserted after it has been deleted. Our goal is to count the number of distinct elements that were inserted but have not been deleted in a continuous data stream. We also solve this new type of distinct element counting problem in a distributed setting. This problem is motivated by several network monitoring and attack detection applications where network traffic can be modelled as single or distributed dynamic streams and the number of distinct elements in the data streams, such as unsuccessful TCP connection setup requests, is calculated to be used as an indicator to detect certain network events such as service outage and DDoS attacks. Although there are known tight bounds for distinct element counting in insertion-only data streams, no good bounds are known for it in dynamic data streams, neither for this new type of problem. None of the existing solutions for distinct element counting can solve our problem. In this paper, we will present the first solution to this problem, using a space-bounded data structure with a computation-efficient probabilistic data streaming algorithm to estimate the number of distinct elements in single or distributed dynamic data streams.

However, it is quite difficult for a batch-oriented processing system to progressively provide cumulatively accurate results in the context of a distributed environment. MapReduce Online extends the MapReduce framework to support online aggregation, but it is hindered by its processing speed in keeping up with ongoing real-time data events. We deploy the online aggregation algorithm over S4, a scalable stream processing system that is inspired by the combined functionalities of MapReduce and Actor model. Our system applies an asynchronous message communication mechanism from actor model to support online aggregation. It can process large scale data stream with high concurrency in a short response time. In this system, we adopt a distributed weighted random sampling algorithm to solve biased distribution between different streams. Furthermore, a multi-level query processing topology is developed to reduce overlapped processing for multiple queries. Our system can provide continuous window aggregation with a confidence interval and error bound. We have implemented our system and conducted plentiful experiments over the TPC-H benchmark.

Saleh2014700,On efficient processing of linked stream data,"Today, many application areas require continuous processing of data streams in an efficient manner and real-time fashion. Processing these continuous flows of data, integrating dynamic data with other data sources, and providing the required semantics lead to real challenges. Thus, Linked Stream Data (LSD) has been proposed which combines two concepts: Linked Open Data and Data Stream Processing (DSP). Recently, several LSD engines have been developed, including C-SPARQL and CQELS, which are based on SPARQL extensions for continuous query processing. However, this SPARQL-centric view makes it difficult to express complex processing pipelines. In this paper, we propose a LSD engine based on a more general stream processing approach. Instead of a variant of SPARQL, our engine provides a dataflow specification language called Pipe Flow which is compiled into native code. Pipe Flow supports native stream processing operators (e.g., window, aggregates, and joins), complex event processing as well as RDF data transformation operators such as tuplifier and triplifier to efficiently support LSD queries and provide a higher degree of expressiveness. We discuss the main concepts addressing the challenges of LSD processing and describe the usage of these concepts for processing queries from LSBench and SRBench.

For several offline computational applications, such as fine grained batch processing, their parallel nature in addition to weak consistency requirements allowed a more trivial transition. On the other hand, on-line processing systems such as Complex Event Processing (CEP) still maintain a monolithic architecture, being able to offer high expressiveness and vertical scalability at the expense of low distribution. Despite attempts to design dedicated distributed CEP systems there is potential for existing systems to benefit from a sustainable cloud deployment. In this work we address the main challenges of providing such a CEP service with a focus on reliability, since it is the most crucial aspect of that transition. Our approach targets low average detection latency and sustain-ability by leveraging event delegation mechanisms present on existing stream execution platforms.

In addition, multimedia processing is resource consuming and, in many cases, unsuitable for a plethora of resource-constrained devices. To overcome these challenges, we present MobiStream a device-to-device multimedia streaming system for resource-constrained devices that achieves efficient handling of live multimedia streams. The design of MobiStream architecture provides solutions to several issues including resource constraints, streaming among heterogeneous operating systems and platforms, generation, synchronization and presentation of multimedia streams.

Alias2012391,Real-time multiple video streams processing on PC-based FPGA platform,Programmable embedded media server based video surveillance system is prevalent as it has the capability to accommodate large network of cameras. The implementation of a wide range of programmable security analytics application in PC-based platform demands high processing bandwidth and high-end hardware specification requirements. This is due to insufficient compute resource by multicore CPU in performing some of the computationally intensive analytics operations at acceptable data rates. This paper presents a platform design considerations for programmable video analytics solving compute intensive video data processing leading to cost-efficient embedded platform solution. Our experimental analysis covers PC-based processing pipeline analysis for CPU resources to be used as design input for processing data offloading between multicore CPU and FPGA. The result identifies the processing bottleneck in PC-based media server with video analytics processing component consumes 81% of the total CPU processing cycles.

Krishnamurthy2003655,"On network CoProcessors for scalable, predictable media services","This paper presents the embedded realization and experimental evaluation of a media stream scheduler on Network Interface (NI) CoProcessor boards. When using media frames as scheduling units, the scheduler is able to operate in real-time on streams traversing the Coprocessor, resulting in its ability to stream video to remote clients at real-time rates. The contributions of this paper are its detailed evaluation of the effects of placing application or kernel-level functionality, like packet scheduling on NIs, rather than the host machines to which they are attached. The main benefits of such placement are 1) that traffic is eliminated from the host bus and memory subsystem, thereby allowing increased host CPU utilization for other tasks, and 2) that NI-based scheduling is immune to host-CPU loading, unlike host-based media schedulers that are easily affected even by transient load conditions. An outcome of this work is a proposed cluster architecture for building scalable media servers by distributing schedulers and media stream producers across the multiple NIs used by a single server and by clustering a number of such servers using commodity network hardware and software.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Krishnamurthy, R. and Schwan, K. and West, R. and Rosu, M.-C.",2003,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,10.1109/TPDS.2003.1214318,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib
Livaja2022282,A distributed geospatial publish/subscribe system on Apache Spark,"Publish/subscribe is a messaging pattern where message producers, called publishers, publish messages which they want to be distributed to message consumers, called subscribers. Subscribers are required to subscribe to messages of interest in advance to be able to receive them upon the publishing. In this paper, we discuss a special type of publish/subscribe systems, namely geospatial publish/subscribe systems (GeoPS systems), in which both published messages (i.e., publications) and subscriptions include a geospatial object. Such an object is used to express both the location information of a publication and the location of interest of a subscription. We argue that there is great potential for using GeoPS systems for the Internet of Things and Sensor Web applications. However, existing GeoPS systems are not applicable for this purpose since they are centralized and cannot cope with multiple highly frequent incoming geospatial data streams containing publications. To overcome this limitation, we present a distributed GeoPS system in the cluster which efficiently matches incoming publications in real-time with a set of stored subscriptions. Additionally, we propose four different (distributed) replication and partitioning strategies for managing subscriptions in our distributed GeoPS system. Finally, we present results of an extensive experimental evaluation in which we compare the throughput, latency and memory consumption of these strategies. These results clearly show that they are both efficient and scalable to larger clusters. The comparison with centralized state-of-the-art approaches shows that the additional processing overhead of our distributed strategies introduced by the Apache Spark is almost negligible.

That way the model can be used to solve tasks such as optimizing the placement of operators to minimize the end-to-end latency of a streaming query or maximize its throughput even under varying conditions.

Lv2022249,"Walle: An End-to-End, General-Purpose, and Large-Scale Production System for Device-Cloud Collaborative Machine Learning","To break the bottlenecks of mainstream cloud-based machine learning (ML) paradigm, we adopt device-cloud collaborative ML and build the first end-to-end and general-purpose system, called Walle, as the foundation. Walle consists of a deployment platform, distributing ML tasks to billion-scale devices in time; a data pipeline, efficiently preparing task input; and a compute container, providing a cross-platform and high-performance execution environment, while facilitating daily task iteration. Specifically, the compute container is based on Mobile Neural Network (MNN), a tensor compute engine along with the data processing and model execution libraries, which are exposed through a refined Python thread-level virtual machine (VM) to support diverse ML tasks and concurrent task execution. The core of MNN is the novel mechanisms of operator decomposition and semi-auto search, sharply reducing the workload in manually optimizing hundreds of operators for tens of hardware backends and further quickly identifying the best backend with runtime optimization for a computation graph. The data pipeline introduces an on-device stream processing framework to enable processing user behavior data at source. The deployment platform releases ML tasks with an efficient push-then-pull method and supports multi-granularity deployment policies. We evaluate Walle in practical e-commerce application scenarios to demonstrate its effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability. Extensive micro-benchmarks also highlight the superior performance of MNN and the Python thread-level VM. Walle has been in large-scale production use in Alibaba, while MNN has been open source with a broad impact in the community. © 2022 by The USENIX Association.

Gütlein202218,On-demand Simulation of Future Mobility Based on Apache Kafka,"The modeling and simulation community can benefit from building and running (co-)simulation models on-demand. In order to drive innovation further, it should be easy to set up, orchestrate, and execute simulations – even for researchers with no background in computer science. Additionally, open interfaces should be the default to enable a variety of applications. The possibility to connect external components smoothly with a simulation run allows for elaborate experiments. In this work, the details of the architecture and design of a simulation platform enabling evaluations of future mobility scenarios are presented. While the explanations are based on mobility applications, the concept can be generalized and applied to other domains. The novelty lies in the use of a big data stream processing platform called Apache Kafka. All kinds of required communication are handled by the Kafka middleware. Even the coupling of different simulators is realized on top of it. As a foundation, existing works regarding Modeling and Simulation as a Service are presented. The approach is then described by its architecture, its interfaces, and the life-cycle of a simulation run.

Daghistani2021_62,SWARM: Adaptive load balancing in distributed streaming systems for big spatial data,"The proliferation of GPS-enabled devices has led to the development of numerous location-based services. These services need to process massive amounts of streamed spatial data in real-time. The current scale of spatial data cannot be handled using centralized systems. This has led to the development of distributed spatial streaming systems. Existing systems are using static spatial partitioning to distribute the workload. In contrast, the real-time streamed spatial data follows non-uniform spatial distributions that are continuously changing over time. Distributed spatial streaming systems need to react to the changes in the distribution of spatial data and queries. This article introduces SWARM, a lightweight adaptivity protocol that continuously monitors the data and query workloads across the distributed processes of the spatial data streaming system and redistributes and rebalances the workloads as soon as performance bottlenecks get detected. SWARM is able to handle multiple query-execution and data-persistence models. A distributed streaming system can directly use SWARM to adaptively rebalance the system's workload among its machines with minimal changes to the original code of the underlying spatial application. Extensive experimental evaluation using real and synthetic datasets illustrate that, on average, SWARM achieves 2 improvement in throughput over a static grid partitioning that is determined based on observing a limited history of the data and query workloads. Moreover, SWARM reduces execution latency on average 4 compared with the other technique. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Daghistani, A. and Aref, W.G. and Ghafoor, A. and Mahmood, A.R.",2021,ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,10.1145/3460013,scopus-search1.bib;acm1-search1.bib

Fang20211861,A-DSP: An adaptive join algorithm for dynamic data stream on cloud system,"The join operations, including both equi and non-equi joins, are essential to the complex data analytics in the big data era. However, they are not inherently supported by existing DSPEs (Distributed Stream Processing Engines). The state-of-the-art join solutions on DSPEs rely on either complicated routing strategies or resource-inefficient processing structures, which are susceptible to dynamic workload, especially when the DSPEs face various join predicate operations and skewed data distribution. In this paper, we propose a new cost-effective stream join framework, named A-DSP (Adaptive Dimensional Space Processing), which enhances the adaptability of real-time join model and minimizes the resource used over the dynamic workloads. Our proposal includes: 1) a join model generation algorithm devised to adaptively switch between different join schemes so as to minimize the number of processing task required; 2) a load-balancing mechanism which maximizes the processing throughput; and 3) a lightweight algorithm designed for cutting down unnecessary migration cost.

Runsewe2021504,Cloud resource scaling for time-bounded and unbounded big data streaming applications,"Recent advancements in technology have led to a deluge of big data streams that require real-time analysis with strict latency constraints. A major challenge, however, is determining the amount of resources required by applications processing these streams given their high volume, velocity and variety. The majority of research efforts on resource scaling in the cloud are investigated from the cloud provider's perspective with little consideration for multiple resource bottlenecks. We aim at analyzing the resource scaling problem from an application provider's point of view such that efficient scaling decisions can be made. This paper provides two contributions to the study of resource scaling for big data streaming applications in the cloud. First, we present a Layered Multi-dimensional Hidden Markov Model (LMD-HMM) for managing time-bounded streaming applications. Second, to cater to unbounded streaming applications, we propose a framework based on a Layered Multi-dimensional Hidden Semi-Markov Model (LMD-HSMM). The parameters in our models are evaluated using modified Forward and Backward algorithms.

Ojo2021559,A reliable peer-to-peer streaming protocol in low-capacity networks,"The recent global demand for video streaming applications has paved the way for peer-to-peer streaming system (P2PSS). Strategic scheduling scheme and dynamic overlay topology are essential to maintain quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) in P2PSS. The concept of P2PSS was tailored towards relying on active peers’ bandwidth to achieve cheap and scalable means of distribution over the Internet, such that peers with highest bandwidth serve as backbones for others. However, selecting backbone peers in low-capacity network environment is challenging due to insufficient bandwidth and poor infrastructure, thereby resulting in poor QoS and unpleasant user’s QoE. In this paper, we conducted a survey on users’ experiences with live video in selected locations in Nigeria. We designed an adaptive P2P streaming protocol and performed a packet-level simulation in Network Simulator 3(NS-3). Diverse simulation scenarios were set up to evaluate the proposed streaming protocol. Trace files data were analysed to measure end-to-end delay, start-up delay, and throughput. Furthermore, the proposed streaming protocol was benchmarked against selected existing schemes.

Qi2021,A Traffic and Resource Aware Online Storm Scheduler,"Streaming applications have become widespread with the advent of big data and IoT. They are latency-sensitive applications that aim to process vast amounts of data in near real time. They are usually modelled as directed graphs and their deployment and orchestration in a cluster of nodes are managed by distributed stream processing systems. These systems are responsible for placing the graph components within the cluster nodes, which determines the application's communication overhead and ultimately affects performance metrics such as latency and throughput. This work presents an adaptive, heuristic-based, scheduling algorithm for distributed stream processing systems that aims to minimize the latency and maximize the throughput of streaming applications deployed in heterogeneous clusters, while considering the resource constraints of the available nodes. The proposed approach uses a graph partitioning algorithm and real time traffic data monitored from a deployed application to derive a near-optimal operator placement plan that minimizes inter-node communication and balances the overall communication load distribution. We evaluated our approach using three micro-benchmark and two practical applications, and the results demonstrate that our scheduler outperforms the default scheduler of a popular stream processing system and a state-of-the-art algorithm, improving throughput by up to 106% and reducing complete latency by up to 58% for most applications. © 2021 ACM.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Qi, T. and Rodriguez, M.",2021,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,10.1145/3437378.3444365,scopus-search1.bib;acm1-search1.bib

However, for queries containing commonly used blocking operators such as windows, this scheduling approach can be inefficient. Watermarks are events popularly utilized by SPEs to correctly process window operators. Watermarks are injected into the stream to signify that no events preceding their timestamp should be further expected. Through the design and development of Klink, we leverage these watermarks to robustly infer stream progress based on window deadlines and network delay, and to schedule query pipeline execution that reflects stream progress. Klink aims to unblock window operators and to rapidly propagate events to output operators while performing judicious memory management. We integrate Klink into the popular open source SPE Apache Flink and demonstrate that Klink delivers significant performance gains over existing scheduling policies on benchmark workloads for both scale-up and scale-out deployments. © 2021 ACM.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Farhat, O. and Daudjee, K. and Querzoni, L.",2021,Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,10.1145/3448016.3452794,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;acm1-search1.bib
Sornalakshmi2021,Dynamic Auto Reconfiguration of Operator Placement in Wireless Distributed Stream Processing Systems,"The data is generated at significant speed and volume by devices in real-time. The data generation and the growth of fog and edge computing infrastructure have led to the noteworthy development of the corresponding distributed stream processing systems (DSPS). A DSPS application has Quality of Service (QoS) restrictions in terms of resource cost and time. The physical resources are distributed and heterogeneous. The resource-constrained scheduling problem has considerable implications on the performance of the system and QoS violations. The static deployment of applications in fog or edge scenario has to be monitored continuously for runtime issues, and actions have to be taken accordingly. In this paper, we propose an adaptation capability with reinforcement learning techniques to an existing stream processing framework scheduler. This functionality enables the scheduler to make decisions on its own when the system model or knowledge of the environment is not known upfront. The reinforcement learning methods adapt to the system when the system model for different states is not available. We consider applications whose workload cannot be characterized or predicted. In such applications, predictions of input load are not helpful for online scheduling. The Q-Learning based online scheduler learns to make dynamic scaling decisions at runtime when there is performance degradation. We validated the proposed approach with real-time and benchmark applications on a DSPS cluster. We obtained an average of 6% reduction in the response time and a 15% increase in the throughput when the Q Learning module is employed in the scheduler. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Sornalakshmi, K. and Vadivu, G.",2021,Wireless Personal Communications,10.1007/s11277-021-08264-y,scopus-search1.bib
Gilroy20202957,Agent-Navigable Dynamic Graph Construction and Visualization over Distributed Memory,"Some graph analyses, such as social network and biological network, need large-scale graph construction and maintenance over distributed memory space. Distributed data-streaming tools, including MapReduce and Spark, restrict some computational freedom of incremental graph modification and run-time graph visualization. Instead, we take an agent-based approach. We construct a graph from a scientific dataset in CSV, tab, and XML formats; dispatch many reactive agents on it; and analyze the graph in the form of their collective group behavior: propagation, flocking, and collision. The key to success is how to automate the run-time construction and visualization of agent-navigable graphs mapped over distributed memory. We implemented this distributed graph-computing support in the multi-agent spatial simulation (MASS) library, coupled with the Cytoscape graph visualization software.

Hoseinyfarahabady2020,A Dynamic Resource Controller for Resolving Quality of Service Issues in Modern Streaming Processing Engines,"Devising an elastic resource allocation controller of data analytical applications in virtualized data-center has received a great attention recently, mainly due to the fact that even a slight performance improvement can translate to huge monetary savings in practical large-scale execution. Apache Flink is among modern streamed data processing run-times that can provide both low latency and high throughput computation in to execute processing pipelines over high-volume and high-velocity data-items under tight latency constraints. However, a yet to be answered challenge in a large-scale platform with tens of worker nodes is how to resolve the run-time violation in the quality of service (QoS) level in a multi-tenant data streaming platforms, particularly when the amount of workload generated by different users fluctuates. Studies showed that a static resource allocation algorithm (round-robin), which is used by default in Apache Flink, suffer from lack of responsiveness to sudden traffic surges happening unpredictably during the run-time. In this paper, we address the problem of resource management in a Flink platform for ensuring different QoS enforcement levels in a platform with shared computing resources. The proposed solution applies theoretical principals borrowed from close-loop control theory to design a CPU and memory adjustment mechanism with the primary goal to fulfill the different QoS levels requested by submitted applications while the resource interference is considered as the critical performance-limiting factor. The performance evaluation is carried out by comparing the proposed resource allocation mechanism with two static heuristics (round robin and class-based weighted fair queuing) in a 80-core cluster under multiple traffic patterns resembling sudden changes in the incoming workloads of low-priory streaming applications. The experimental results confirm the stability of the proposed controller to regulate the underlying platform resources to smoothly follow the target values (QoS violation rates). Particularly, the proposed solution can achieve higher efficiency compared to the other heuristics by reducing the response-time of high priority applications by 53% while maintaining the enforced QoS levels during the burst traffic periods. © 2020 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Hoseinyfarahabady, M.R. and Taheri, J. and Zomaya, A.Y. and Tari, Z.",2020,"2020 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications, NCA 2020",10.1109/NCA51143.2020.9306697,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee2-search1.bib

Accordingly, real-time streaming data processing technology has been developed, and representative platforms include Apache Storm, Apache Spark, and Hadoop. These processing technologies provide scalability to configure distributed systems using multiple servers because they vary in performance, such as throughput and processing speed, depending on the server environment, but the more the number of servers, the more difficult it is to manage. To solve this problem, a problem can be solved by using a docker, a kind of virtualization system that provides ease of expansion. However, there is a place to maintain a native environment without using Docker due to the problem that performance may be reduced, which is a disadvantage of all virtualization systems.

Zhang20207156,Dynamic Component Placement and Request Scheduling for IoT Big Data Streaming,"Internet-of-Things (IoT) big data streaming applications, such as video surveillance and automatic driving, tend to use mobile-edge computing (MEC) infrastructure to enhance their performance and augment their functionalities. Although extensive previous studies have worked on offloading requests to MEC servers, none of them has comprehensively and thoroughly considered the important features of IoT data streaming applications (i.e., component dependency and dynamic arrival) and the infrastructure provisioning (i.e., capacity constraint and colocation interference). In this article, we consider the offloading problem for dynamically arrived IoT data streaming requests on MEC servers in real time. We model it as a delay-sensitive multiuser multiresource online offloading problem respecting component dependency and capacity constraint. The problem is NP-hard with offloading decisions coupling together. To solve it, we decouple the problem into component placement problem and request scheduling problem and propose a two-stage DPGPD algorithm with polynomial time complexity. We show the first stage dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is the optimal solution and the second-stage greedy primal–dual (GPD) algorithm is asymptotic optimal. The simulation results show that our solution is effective yet efficient compared to benchmark solutions. (DP provides the optimal placement layout with $12 \times $ less decision time of Gurobi; and GPD provides the asymptotic optimal scheduling with $5 \times $ less average waiting time compared to least work left (LWL) in heavy workload.)

Presser202039,EdgeScaler: Effective elastic scaling for graph stream processing systems,"Existing solutions for elastic scaling perform poorly with graph stream processing for two key reasons. First, when the system is scaled, the graph must be dynamically re-partitioned among workers. This requires a partitioning algorithm that is fast and offers good locality, a task that is far from being trivial. Second, existing modelling techniques for distributed graph processing systems only consider hash partitioning, and do not leverage the semantic knowledge used by more efficient partitioners. In this paper we propose EdgeScaler, an elastic scaler for graph stream processing systems that tackles these challenges by employing, in a synergistic way, two innovative techniques: MicroMacroSplitter and AccuLocal. MicroMacroSplitter is a new edge-based graph partitioning strategy that is as fast as simple hash partinioners, while achieving quality comparable to the best state-of-the-art solutions. AccuLocal is a novel performance model that takes the partitioner features into account while avoiding expensive off-line training phases. An extensive experimental evaluation offers insights on the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms and shows that EdgeScaler is able to significantly outperform existing solutions designed for generic stream processing systems. © 2020 ACM.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Presser, D. and Siqueira, F. and Rodrigues, L. and Romano, P.",2020,DEBS 2020 - Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-Based Systems,10.1145/3401025.3401734,scopus-search1.bib;acm1-search1.bib
Weißbach2020138,Performance analysis of continuous binary data processing using distributed databases within stream processing environments,"Big data applications must process increasingly large amounts of data within ever shorter time. Often a stream processing engine (SPE) is used to process incoming data with minimal latency. While these engines are designed to process data quickly, they are not made to persist and manage it. Thus, databases are still integrated into streaming architectures, which often becomes a performance bottleneck. To overcome this issue and achieve maximum performance, all system components used must be examined in terms of their throughput and latency, and how well they interact with each other. Several authors have already analyzed the performance of popular distributed database systems. While doing so, we focus on the interaction between the SPEs and the databases, as we assume that stream processing leads to changes in the access patterns to the databases. Moreover, our main focus is on the efficient storing and loading of binary data objects rather than typed data, since in our use cases the actual data analysis is not to be performed by the database, but by the SPE.We've benchmarked common databases within streaming environments to determine which software combination is best suited for these requirements. Our results show that the database performance differs significantly depending on the access pattern used and that different software combinations lead to substantial performance differences. Depending on the access pattern, Cassandra, MongoDB and PostgreSQL achieved the best throughputs, which were mostly the highest when Apache Flink was used. © Copyright 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Twaty20193744,GraphOpt: A Framework for Automatic Parameters Tuning of Graph Processing Frameworks,"Finding the optimal configuration of a black-box system is a difficult problem that requires a lot of time and human labor. Big data processing frameworks are among the increasingly popular systems whose tuning is a complex and time consuming. The challenge of automatically finding the optimal parameters of big data frameworks attracted a lot of research in recent years. Some of the studies focused on optimizing specific frameworks such as distributed stream processing [1], [2], or finding the best cloud configurations [3], while others proposed general services for optimizing any black-box system [4]. In this paper, we introduce a new use case in the domain of automatic parameter tuning: optimizing the parameters of distributed graph processing frameworks. This task is notably difficult given the particular challenges of distributed graph processing that include the graph partitioning and the iterative nature of graph algorithms. To address this challenge, we designed and implemented GraphOpt: an efficient and scalable black-box optimization framework that automatically tunes distributed graph processing frameworks. GraphOpt implements state-of-the-art optimization algorithms and introduces a new hill-climbing-based search algorithm. These algorithms are used to optimize the performance of two major graph processing frameworks: Giraph and GraphX.

Mytilinis201973,Maintaining wavelet synopses for sliding-window aggregates,"The IoT era has brought forth a computing paradigm shift from traditional high-end servers to “edge” devices of limited processing and memory capabilities. These devices, together with sensors, regularly produce very high data volumes nowadays. For many real-time applications, storing and indexing an unbounded stream may not be an option. Thus, it is important that we design algorithms and systems that can both work at the edge of the network and be able to answer queries on distributed, streaming data. Moreover, in many streaming scenarios, fresh data tend to be prioritized. A sliding-window model is an important case of stream processing, where only the most recent elements remain active and the rest are discarded. In this work, we study the problem of maintaining basic aggregate statistics over a sliding-window data stream under the constraint of limited memory. As in IoT scenarios the available memory is typically much less than the window size, queries are answered from compact synopses that are maintained in an on-line fashion. For the efficient construction of such synopses, in this work, we propose wavelet-based algorithms that provide deterministic guarantees and produce almost exact results. Our algorithms can work on any kind of numerical data and do not have the positive-numbers constraint of techniques such as the exponential histograms.

Al-Sayeh2019117,Gray box modeling methodology for runtime prediction of apache spark jobs,"Nowadays, many data centers facilitate data processing and acquisition by developing multiple Apache Spark jobs which can be executed in private clouds with various parameters. Each job might take various application parameters which influence its execution time. Some examples of application parameters can be a selected area of interest in spatiotemporal data processing application or a time range of events in a complex event stream processing application. To predict its runtime accurately, these application parameters shall be considered during constructing its runtime model. Runtime prediction of Spark jobs allows us to schedule them efficiently in order to utilize cloud resources, increase system throughput, reduce job latency and meet customers requirements, e.g. deadlines and QoS. Also, the prediction is considered as important advantage when using a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

The second one is extracting a black box runtime model of each task by observing its runtime metrics according to various allocated resources and variant input RDD sizes.

Unfortunately, neither Shivers and Might’s original work nor the equivalence proof sheds much light on the underlying principles allowing the derivation of this efficient representation from its specification. This paper gives the missing insight by reconstructing a systematic derivation in terms of known transformation steps from the simple specification to the efficient representation. This derivation sheds light on the limitations of the representation and on its applicability to other settings.

Zhou201835,A real-time sensor network aggregation computing system,"With the advent of Cloud Era, real-time streaming data processing applications are used more and more widely. As a concrete example, real-time queries on a large number of sensors are highly demanding and needs to be carefully designed. Sensor monitoring analysts are inexperienced on coding techniques in spite of the rapid development of real-time processing platforms and communities. What's more, the state-of-the-art systems lacks support for multi-query processing and sharing of the original data and results with prior information of the queries. To tackle the challenges, we endeavor to design a light-weight but effective scheme to support multiple queries running on a large number of sensors. We focus on aggregations on sliding windows due to its practical importance, and hence design a query language, SAQL, for the professional analysts to construct their own streaming computational logic. We also propose the whole system, SAQS, which can interpret SAQL into stream processing programs and support the efficient execution of multiple queries in a distributed real-time environment.

Hoseinyfarahabady2018554,Elastic CPU cap mechanism for timely dataflow applications,"Sudden surges in the incoming workload can cause adverse consequences on the run-time performance of data-flow applications. Our work addresses the problem of limiting CPU associated with the elastic scaling of timely data-flow (TDF) applications running in a shared computing environment while each application can possess a different quality of service (QoS) requirement. The key argument here is that an unwise consolidation decision to dynamically scale up/out the computing resources for responding to unexpected workload changes can degrade the performance of some (if not all) collocated applications due to their fierce competition getting the shared resources (such as the last level cache). The proposed solution uses a queue-based model to predict the performance degradation of running data-flow applications together. The problem of CPU cap adjustment is addressed as an optimization problem, where the aim is to reduce the quality of service violation incidents among applications while raising the CPU utilization level of server nodes as well as preventing the formation of bottlenecks due to the fierce competition among collocated applications. The controller uses and efficient dynamic method to find a solution at each round of the controlling epoch. The performance evaluation is carried out by comparing the proposed controller against an enhanced QoS-aware version of round robin strategy which is deployed in many commercial packages.

The information captured in a single event, e.g., GPS position information of mobile phone users, loses value (perishes) over time and requires sub-second latency responses. Conventional Cloud-based batch-processing platforms are inadequate to meet these constraints. Existing streaming engines exhibit low throughput and are thus equally ill-suited for emerging Big Data streaming applications. To validate this claim, we evaluated the Yahoo streaming benchmark and our own real-time trend detector on three state-of-the-art streaming engines: Apache Storm, Apache Flink and Spark Streaming. We adapted the Kieker dynamic profiling framework to gather accurate profiling information on the throughput and CPU utilization exhibited by the two benchmarks on the Google Compute Engine. To estimate the performance overhead incurred by current streaming engines, we re-implemented our Java-based trend detector as a multi-threaded, shared-memory application in C++. The achieved throughput of 3.2 million events per second on a stand-alone 2 CPU (44 cores) Intel Xeon E5-2699 v4 server is 44 times higher than the maximum throughput achieved with the Apache Storm version of the trend detector deployed on 30 virtual machines (nodes) in the Cloud. Our experiment suggests vertical scaling as a viable alternative to horizontal scaling, especially if shared state has to be maintained in a streaming application.

Walulya2018129,Viper: Communication-layer determinism and scaling in low-latency stream processing,"Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) process continuous streams of data and produce up-to-date results in a real-time fashion, typically through one-at-a-time tuple analysis. When looking into the vital SPE processing properties required from applications, determinism has a strong position besides scalability in throughput and low processing latency. SPEs scale in throughput and latency by relying on shared-nothing parallelism, deploying multiple copies of each operator to which tuples are distributed based on the semantics of the operator. The coordination of the asynchronous analysis of parallel operators required to enforce determinism is then carried out by additional dedicated sorting operators. In this work we shift such costly coordination to the communication layer of the SPE. Specifically, we extend earlier work on shared-memory implementations of deterministic operators and provide a communication module (Viper) which can be integrated in the SPE communication layer. Using Apache Storm and the Linear Road benchmark, we show the benefits that can be achieved by our approach in terms of throughput and energy efficiency of SPEs implementing one-at-a-time analysis. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Walulya, I. and Nikolakopoulos, Y. and Gulisano, V. and Papatriantafilou, M. and Tsigas, P.",2018,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10.1007/978-3-319-75178-8_11,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib
Chakraborty201721,Priority based resource scheduling techniques for a resource constrained stream processing system,"A multitenant Storm cluster runs multiple stream processing applications and uses the default Isolation Scheduler to schedule them. Isolation Scheduler assigns resources to topologies based on static resource configuration and does not provide any means for prioritizing topologies based on their varying business requirements. Thus, performance degradation, even complete starvation of topologies with high priority is possible when the cluster is resource constrained and comprises an inadequate number of resources.

Wang2017497,Performance evaluation of parallelizing algorithm using spanning tree for stream-based computing,"This paper proposes a detailed performance evaluation of an algorithm using spanning tree that automatically exploits the parallelism and determines an execution order of multiple kernel programs in distributed environment. In stream-based computing, efficient parallel execution requires careful scheduling of the invocation of the kernel programs. By mapping a kernel to a node and an I/O stream between kernels to an edge, the entire stream process can be treated as a spanning tree. The spanning tree, which allows feedback and feedforward edges, is effective for expressing dependencies that exist among kernels. In spanning tree, the nodes at the same depth do not have edges between them, and thus can be executed in parallel in the case parent nodes have been already executed. The series of the nodes can be executed in a pipelined manner. Thus, the proposed algorithm can extract both spatial and temporal parallelism. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, two applications have been developed and parallelized based on the proposed algorithm. The results show that the parallel execution using four nodes of a GPU cluster obtained 3.5 times speedup in 2D-FFT and 3.0 times speedup in LU decomposition, compared to the sequential execution. © 2016 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Wang, G. and Wada, K. and Yamagiwa, S.",2016,"Proceedings - 2016 4th International Symposium on Computing and Networking, CANDAR 2016",10.1109/CANDAR.2016.62,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib

Nowadays, sensors for recording time series are omnipresent as RFID chips, wearables, smart homes, or event-based systems.

Classification time is a key challenge given new applications like event-based monitoring, real-time decision or streaming systems. This paper is the first benchmark that compares 12 state of the art time series classifiers based on prediction and classification times.

Sahni2017399,Scalable online analytics on cloud infrastructures,"The need for low latency analysis of high velocity real time continuous data streams has led to the emergence of Stream Processing Systems (SPSs). Contemporary SPSs allow a stream processing application to be hosted on Cloud infrastructures and dynamically scaled so as to adapt to the fluctuating data rates. However, the run time scalability incorporated in these SPSs are in their early adaptations and are based on simple local/global threshold based controls. This work studies the issues with the local and global auto scaling techniques that may lead to performance inefficiencies in real time traffic analysis on Cloud platforms and presents an efficient hybrid auto scaling strategy StreamScale which addresses the identified issues. The proposed StreamScale auto-scaling algorithm accounts for the gaps in the local/global scaling approaches and effectively identifies (de)parallelization opportunities in stream processing applications for maintaining QoS at reduced costs.

Zacheilas201719,DIsCO: Dynamic data compression in distributed stream processing systems,"Supporting high throughput in Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPSs) has been an important goal in recent years. Current works either focus on automatically increasing the system resources whenever the current setup is inadequate or apply load shedding techniques discarding some of the incoming data. However, both approaches have significant shortcomings as they require on the fly application reconfiguration where the application needs to be stopped and re-uploaded in the cluster with the new configurations, and can lead to significant information loss. One approach that has not yet been considered for improving the throughput of DSPSs is exploiting compression algorithms to minimize the communication overhead between components especially in cases where we have large-sized data like live CCTV camera reports. This work is the first that provides a novel framework, built on top of Apache Storm, which enables dynamic compression of incoming streaming data. Our approach uses a profiling algorithm to automatically determine the compression algorithm that should be applied and supports both lossless and lossy compression techniques. Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm for determining when profiling should be applied.

Most of the papers focus on metrics such as throughput, latency and memory consumption. However, there are other metrics, which system administrators and users should consider, such as information latency, the correctness of results, adaptability on different workloads and others. Therefore, in this paper, we summarized some key metrics used to assess systems for processing online data streams.

An S-NET application is a network of black-box compute components connected through anonymous data streams, with the standard input and output streams linking the application to the environment. Our case study is based on two applications: a face detection algorithm implemented as a pipeline of feature classifiers and a numerical algorithm from the linear algebra domain, namely Cholesky decomposition. The selected applications are representative and have been selected by Intel researchers as evaluation testbeds for CnC in the past. We implement various versions of both algorithms in S-NET and compare them with equivalent CnC implementations, both with and without tuning, previously published by the CnC community. Our experiments on a large-scale server system demonstrate that S-Net delivers very similar scalability and absolute performance on the studied examples as tuned CnC codes do, even without specific tuning.

Vögler2016190,Non-intrusive monitoring of stream processing applications,"Stream processing applications have emerged as a popular way for implementing high-volume data processing tasks. In contrast to traditional data processing models that persist data to databases and then execute queries on the stored data, stream processing applications continuously execute complex queries on incoming data to produce timely results in reaction to events observed in the processed data. To cope with the request load, components of a stream processing application are usually distributed across multiple machines. In this context, performance monitoring and testing are naturally important for stakeholders to understand as well as analyze the runtime characteristics of deployed applications to identify issues and inform decisions. Existing approaches for monitoring the performance of distributed systems, however, do not provide sufficient support for targeted monitoring of stream processing applications, and require changes to the application code to enable the integration of application-specific monitoring data. In this paper we present MOSAIC, a service oriented framework that allows for in-depth analysis of stream processing applications by non-intrusively adding functionality for acquiring and publishing performance measurements at runtime, to the application. Furthermore, MOSAIC provides a flexible mechanism for integrating different stream processing frameworks, which can be used for executing and monitoring applications independent from a specific operator model. Additionally, our framework provides an extensible approach for gathering and analyzing measurement data.

Maamar20161769,A performance evaluation of mobility management and multihop supplying partner strategies for 3D streaming systems over thin mobile devices,"The recent advances in technology and mobile computing led to the rapid growth of networked 3D streaming applications. The emerging services can involve augmented reality, virtual environment walkthrough, multiplayer gaming just to mention a few. Because of the limited network bandwidth of the client-server approach, research works are now turning toward mobile ad hoc networks-based streaming, where the resources of each peer are used during the streaming service. Peer-to-peer technologies are considering the solution to adapt for scalable applications. Yet, supplying partner selection and 3D data delivery are still significant challenges to face because of the dynamic wireless environment that causes link breakages, high packet loss, an adverse impact on the quality of the 3D media, and a low user satisfaction. In this paper, we propose a supplying partner selection technique coupled with a content delivery technique for peer-to-peer 3D streaming over thin mobile devices. Our proposed protocol, which we refer to as MULTIPLY, considers multihop suppliers in order to alleviate the load on the server and uses the signal strength measurement to analyze the wireless link when sending back the 3D data. Given the high dynamicity of the network due to the mobility of the users, the streaming can be greatly affected. We therefore study the impact of the mobility on MULTIPLY. The performance evaluation of our protocol obtained using an extensive set of simulation experiments is then reported.

Rattanaopas2016,Performance analysis of a multi-tier video on demand service on virtualization platforms,"Cloud computing technology, especially virtualization is employed in many data centers nowadays. The key concept of virtualization concerns elastic or scalable infrastructure. This concept can be implemented by exploiting multi-tier web applications and hypervisors which are virtual machine management software. Xen hypervisor has presented its Version 4.4 in 2014. In this paper, we present the performance analysis comparison between Xen para-virtualization and KVM full virtualization on the case study of open source video streaming called Cumulusclips, a YouTube-like system. This investigation involves real workload mp4 video streaming on 200 clients' browser, running 3 experiments, including large video files (similar to 3 GB), small video files (similar to 120 MB) and random-size video files (the ratio of large and small video files is 25%/75%). The requests size results show that Xen para-virtualization can serve all requests better than KVM full virtualization and use less resource. Xen's performance is dropped when CPU usage is 100% in Experiment 1 (large files). In Experiments 2 (small files) and 3 (random-size files), Xen's CPU usage is under 10%, but KVM's CPU usage is over 50%. The requests size results of Xen and KVM are equal in Experiment 2, but Xen has the maximum throughput about a half (51%) of KVM's.

For that purpose a distributed framework based on convex optimization is developed that achieves optimal resource utilization for multi-interface multi-path network configuration. Although flow splitting can be performed using single wireless interface, our performance evaluation results show an improved performance when employing multiple wireless interfaces. Performance evaluation results reveal that 50% energy saving can be achieved when using optimal flow splitting for dual interface compared to single interface node architecture.

Allani2013423,Hyphen: A hybrid protocol for generic overlay construction in P2P environments,"Overlay networks form the core part of peer-to-peer (P2P) applications such as application-level multicast, content distribution and media streaming. To ease development, middleware solutions and toolkit libraries have been proposed in the past to help with the implementation of overlay networks. Existing solutions, however, are either too generic by only providing low-level communication abstractions, requiring developers to implement algorithms for overlay networks from scratch, or too restrictive by only supporting a particular overlay topology with fixed properties. In this paper, we argue that it is possible to find a middle ground between these two extremes. We describe Hyphen, a middleware for overlay construction and maintenance that supports a range of overlay topologies with custom properties, and show how it can replace topology construction for a variety of application-level multicast systems. Unlike previous efforts, Hyphen can construct and maintain a range of overlay topologies such as trees and forests with specific optimisation goals such as low latency or high bandwidth. By using a gossip-based mechanism to define topologies implicitly, Hyphen can scale to many peers and achieve low construction overhead. Our experimental evaluation with Bullet and Splitstream, two P2P streaming systems, shows that Hyphen can construct a bandwidth-optimised tree for Bullet that achieves a higher streaming rate than the original Bullet implementation, and that it can construct a more reliable forest for Splitstream by taking individual peer reliability into account.

Fernandez201311,Scalable and fault-tolerant stateful stream processing,"As users of ""big data"" applications expect fresh results, we witness a new breed of stream processing systems (SPS) that are designed to scale to large numbers of cloud-hosted machines. Such systems face new challenges: (i) to benefit from the ""pay-as-you-go"" model of cloud computing, they must scale out on demand, acquiring additional virtual machines (VMs) and parallelising operators when the workload increases; (ii) failures are common with deployments on hundreds of VMs-systems must be fault-tolerant with fast recovery times, yet low per-machine overheads. An open question is how to achieve these two goals when stream queries include stateful operators, which must be scaled out and recovered without affecting query results. Our key idea is to expose internal operator state explicitly to the SPS through a set of state management primitives. Based on them, we describe an integrated approach for dynamic scale out and recovery of stateful operators. Externalised operator state is checkpointed periodically by the SPS and backed up to upstream VMs. The SPS identifies individual operator bottlenecks and automatically scales them out by allocating new VMs and partitioning the checkpointed state. At any point, failed operators are recovered by restoring checkpointed state on a new VM and replaying unprocessed tuples. We evaluate this approach with the Linear Road Benchmark on the Amazon EC2 cloud platform and show that it can scale automatically to a load factor of L=350 with 50 VMs, while recovering quickly from failures.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Fernandez, R.C. and Migliavacca, M. and Kalyvianaki, E. and Pietzuch, P.",2013,OpenAccess Series in Informatics,10.4230/OASIcs.ICCSW.2013.11,scopus-search1.bib
Burtsev2013,Weir: A streaming language for performance analysis,"For modern software systems, performance analysis can be a challenging task. The software stack can be a complex, multi-layer, multi-component, concurrent, and parallel environment with multiple contexts of execution and multiple sources of performance data. Although much performance data is available, because modern systems incorporate many mature data-collection mechanisms, analysis algorithms suffer from the lack of a unifying programming environment for processing the collected performance data, potentially from multiple sources, in a convenient and script-like manner. This paper presents Weir, a streaming language for systems performance analysis. Weir is based on the insight that performanceanalysis algorithms can be naturally expressed as stream-processing pipelines. In Weir, an analysis algorithm is implemented as a graph composed of stages, where each stage operates on a stream of events that represent collected performance measurements. Weir is an imperative streaming language with a syntax designed for the convenient construction of stream pipelines that utilize composable and reusable analysis stages. To demonstrate practical application, this paper presents the authors' experience in using Weir to analyze performance in systems based on the Xen virtualization platform.

Cazalas201263,Performance Modeling of Spatio-Temporal Algorithms Over GEDS Framework,"The efficient processing of spatio-temporal data streams is an area of intense research. However, all methods rely on an unsuitable processor (Govindaraju, 2004), namely a CPU, to evaluate concurrent, continuous spatio-temporal queries over these data streams. This paper presents a performance model of the execution of spatio-temporal queries over the authors' GEDS framework (Cazalas & Guha, 2010). GEDS is a scalable, Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based framework, employing computation sharing and parallel processing paradigms to deliver scalability in the evaluation of continuous, spatio-temporal queries over spatio temporal data streams. Experimental evaluation shows the scalability and efficacy of GEDS in spatio-temporal data streaming environments and demonstrates that, despite the costs associated with memory transfers, the parallel processing power provided by GEDS clearly counters and outweighs any associated costs. To move beyond the analysis of specific algorithms over the GEDS framework, the authors developed an abstract performance model, detailing the relationship of the CPU and the GPU. From this model, they are able to extrapolate a list of attributes common to successful GPU-based applications, thereby providing insight into which algorithms and applications are best suited for the GPU and also providing an estimated theoretical speedup for said GPU-based applications. © 2012, IGI Global.

The proposed rule-based push-pull scheduler simultaneously pull video chunk from lower latency peers to fill up missing chunks and push video chunk adaptively for rapid chunk delivery. We performed comparative simulation study against rarest first pushpull and status-wise push-pull to prove the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

Cipriani201152,M-TOP: Multi-target operator placement of query graphs for data streams,"Nowadays, many applications processes stream-based data, such as financial market analysis, network intrusion detection, or visualization applications. To process stream-based data in an application-independent manner, distributed stream processing systems emerged. They typically translate a query to an operator graph, place the operators to stream processing nodes, and execute them to process the streamed data. The operator placement is crucial in such systems, as it deeply influences query execution. Often, different stream-based applications require dedicated placement of query graphs according to their specific objectives, e.g. bandwidth not less than 500 MBit/s and costs not more that 1 cost unit. This fact constraints operator placement. Existing approaches do not take into account application-specific objectives, thus not reflecting application-specific placement decisions. As objectives might conflict among each other, operator placement is subject to delicate trade-offs, such as bandwidth maximization is more important than cost reduction. Thus, the challenge is to find a solution which considers the application-specific objectives and their trade-offs. We present M-TOP, an QoS-aware multi-target operator placement framework for data stream systems. Particularly, we propose an operator placement strategy considering application-specific targets consisting of objectives, their respective trade-offs specifications, bottleneck conditions, and ranking schemes to compute a suitable placement. We integrated M-TOP into NexusDS, our distributed data stream processing middleware, and provide an experimental evaluation to show the effectiveness of M-TOP. © 2011 ACM.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Cipriani, N. and Schiller, O. and Mitschang, B.",2011,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,10.1145/2076623.2076631,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;acm2-search1.bib

In this paper we focus on mesh-based, also referred to as generic, unstructured, or data-driven, peer-to-peer video streaming systems. We carry out a performance analysis of these systems, analyzing their sensitivity to the most critical system parameters. The analysis focuses on the number of neighbors of each peer, the average number of peers in the system, the permanence time of peers, and the amount of buffered video. Differently from existing studies we found that, depending on peers' permanence time, an optimal number of neighbors can be found. Moreover, moving towards a higher number of neighbors, the corresponding increase of signaling traffic causes a decrease of overall performance. ©2010 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Giacomazzi, P. and Poli, A.",2010,"2010 International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops, ICUMT 2010",10.1109/ICUMT.2010.5676654,scopus-search1.bib
Nanao201053,Performance analysis of data block synchronization mechanism in coolstreaming,"Coolstreaming is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) based video streaming system in which a single video stream is decomposed into multiple sub-streams and a client-peer node receives the sub-streams from multiple parent-peer nodes, combining them into the original video stream. The buffer of the client-peer node is composed of a synchronization buffer and a cache buffer. Data blocks are stored in the synchronization buffer in a sub-stream basis, and then forwarded into the cache buffer according to their sequence numbers. Here, data-block synchronization is important to guarantee video quality. In this paper, we consider the performance of data-block synchronization scheme with which data blocks are simultaneously forwarded just after all the data blocks composing a macro data block arrive at the synchronization buffer. We model the synchronization buffer as a multiple-buffer queueing system with homogeneous Poisson arrival processes, deriving the mean forwarding interval. We also consider the frame loss probability for multiple-path video streaming, investigating how the number of sub-streams decreases the frame loss probability. Numerical examples show that increasing the number of sub-streams makes the average forwarding interval large, while the frame loss probability at the bottleneck router is improved. It is also shown that increasing the synchronization buffer decreases the average forwarding interval. © 2010 ACM.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Nanao, S. and Masuyama, H. and Kasahara, S. and Takahashi, Y.",2010,"5th International Conference on Queueing Theory and Network Applications, QTNA 2010 - Proceedings",10.1145/1837856.1837865,scopus-search1.bib
Kitchen20091,Chapter 1 The UK HPC Integration Market. Commodity-Based Clusters,"This chapter considers the ubiquitous position of commodity clusters in providing HPC capabilities to the scientific community, and the many issues faced by organizations when deciding how best to procure, maintain, and maximize the usage of such a resource. With a focus on developments within the UK, we provide an overview of the current high-performance computing (HPC) landscape from both the customer and supplier perspective. Historically HPC provision in the UK has been focused on one or two leading-edge national facilities that have helped the UK to develop and maintain an internationally competitive position in research using HPC. This HPC dynamic has, however, changed dramatically in the period 2005-2008 with the major injection of funding into University HPC sector through the Science Research Investment Fund (SRIF). This sector is now the major provider of HPC resources to the UK research base, with the capability of the sector increased 100-fold. Our primary focus lies on the role of HPC Integrators in supplying resources into this sector, and the challenges faced by the HPC service providers themselves in sustaining and growing these activities. The host sites through partnership with the selected integrator aim to maximize this entire process, from procurement through system installation and subsequent lifetime of the service. We ask whether those integrators based primarily in the UK have the ability to provide the necessary level of expertise required in all phases of the process, from procurement to ongoing support of the resource throughout its lifecycle. We consider how current HPC technology roadmaps might impinge on the role of integrators in responding to the undoubted challenges that lie ahead. Crucial issues when considering potential integrator involvement include both size of the hardware solution, that is, number of cores, number of nodes, and the ongoing robustness of open-source software solutions that might be deployed on these platforms. Informed by developments over the past 24 months associated with the deployment of systems funded under SRIF, we provide an in-depth analysis of the current status and capability of a number of the leading HPC Integrators within the UK. Our primary attention is given to the three major companies who now supply the academic community and hence are well known to us-Streamline Computing, ClusterVision, and OCF. Seven other integrators are also considered, albeit with less rigor. Consideration is also given to several of the Tier-1 suppliers of clusters. In reviewing the status of commodity-based systems in scientific and technical computing, systems representative of those supported by the integrators, we consider how an organization might best decide on the optimum technology to deploy against its intended workload. We outline our cluster performance evaluation work that uses a variety of synthetic and application-based floating-point metrics to inform this question. Our analysis relies on performance measurements of application independent tests (microbenchmarks) and a suite of scientific applications that are in active use on many large-scale systems. The microbenchmarks we used provide information on the performance characteristics of the hardware, specifically memory bandwidth and latency, and intercore/interprocessor communication performance. These measurements have been extensively used to provide insight into application performance, with the scientific applications used being taken from existing workloads within the SRIF HPC sector, representing various scientific domains and program structures-molecular dynamics, computational engineering, and materials simulation to name a few.

Henning2022,A configurable method for benchmarking scalability of cloud-native applications,"Cloud-native applications constitute a recent trend for designing large-scale software systems. However, even though several cloud-native tools and patterns have emerged to support scalability, there is no commonly accepted method to empirically benchmark their scalability. In this study, we present a benchmarking method, allowing researchers and practitioners to conduct empirical scalability evaluations of cloud-native applications, frameworks, and deployment options. Our benchmarking method consists of scalability metrics, measurement methods, and an architecture for a scalability benchmarking tool, particularly suited for cloud-native applications. Following fundamental scalability definitions and established benchmarking best practices, we propose to quantify scalability by performing isolated experiments for different load and resource combinations, which asses whether specified service level objectives (SLOs) are achieved. To balance usability and reproducibility, our benchmarking method provides configuration options, controlling the trade-off between overall execution time and statistical grounding. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our method’s configuration options for the special case of event-driven microservices. For this purpose, we use benchmark implementations of the two stream processing frameworks Kafka Streams and Flink and run our experiments in two public clouds and one private cloud. We find that, independent of the cloud platform, it only takes a few repetitions (≤ 5) and short execution times (≤ 5 minutes) to assess whether SLOs are achieved. Combined with our findings from evaluating different search strategies, we conclude that our method allows to benchmark scalability in reasonable time. © 2022, The Author(s).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,INCLUDED,INCLUDED,EXCLUDED,presents a general scalability benchmarking method for cloud-native applications.

Mostafaei2022270,Network-aware worker placement for wide-area streaming analytics,"Many organizations leverage Distributed Stream processing systems (DPSs) to get insights from the data generated by different users/devices, e.g., the Internet of Things (IoT) devices or user clicks on a website, on geographically distributed datacenters. The worker nodes in such environments are connected through Wide Area Network (WAN) links with various delays and bandwidth. Therefore, minimizing the execution latency of a task on the worker nodes while using the links with enough bandwidth and lower cost to steer the traffic of the applications is a challenging task. In this paper, we formulate the worker node placement for a geo-distributed DSPs network as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. Then, we propose an additive weighting-based approach to solve it. The users can prioritize the worker node placement according to the network-relevant parameters. We also propose a framework that can be integrated with the current DPSs to execute the tasks. We test our placement approach on three widely used stream processing systems, i.e., Apache Spark, Apache Storm, and Apache Flink, on three custom graphs adopted from the real cloud providers. We run the streaming query of the Yahoo! streaming benchmark on these three DPSs. The experimental results show that our approach improves the performance of Spark up to 2.2x-7.2x, Storm up to 1.2x-3.4x, and Flink up to 1.4x-3.3x compared with other placement approaches, which makes our framework useful for use in practical environments.

Angbera2022256,A NOVEL TRUE-REAL-TIME SPATIOTEMPORAL DATA STREAM PROCESSING FRAMEWORK,"The ability to interpret spatiotemporal data streams in real time is critical for a range of systems. However, processing vast amounts of spatiotemporal data out of several sources, such as online traffic, social platforms, sensor networks and other sources, is a considerable challenge. The major goal of this study is to create a framework for processing and analyzing spatiotemporal data from multiple sources with irregular shapes, so that researchers can focus on data analysis instead of worrying about the data sources' structure. We introduced a novel spatiotemporal data paradigm for true-real-time stream processing, which enables high-speed and low-latency real-time data processing, with these considerations in mind. A comparison of two state-of-the-art real-time process architectures was offered, as well as a full review of the various open-source technologies for real-time data stream processing and their system topologies were also presented.

Matteussi2022,Performance Evaluation Analysis of Spark Streaming Backpressure for Data-Intensive Pipelines,"A significant rise in the adoption of streaming applications has changed the decision-making processes in the last decade. This movement has led to the emergence of several Big Data technologies for in-memory processing, such as the systems Apache Storm, Spark, Heron, Samza, Flink, and others. Spark Streaming, a widespread open-source implementation, processes data-intensive applications that often require large amounts of memory. However, Spark Unified Memory Manager cannot properly manage sudden or intensive data surges and their related in-memory caching needs, resulting in performance and throughput degradation, high latency, a large number of garbage collection operations, out-of-memory issues, and data loss. This work presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of Spark Streaming backpressure to investigate the hypothesis that it could support data-intensive pipelines under specific pressure requirements. The results reveal that backpressure is suitable only for small and medium pipelines for stateless and stateful applications. Furthermore, it points out the Spark Streaming limitations that lead to in-memory-based issues for data-intensive pipelines and stateful applications.

Wang2022,A comprehensive study on fault tolerance in stream processing systems,"Stream processing has emerged as a useful technology for applications which require continuous and low latency computation on infinite streaming data. Since stream processing systems (SPSs) usually require distributed deployment on clusters of servers in face of large-scale of data, it is especially common to meet with failures of processing nodes or communication networks, but should be handled seriously considering service quality. A failed system may produce wrong results or become unavailable, resulting in a decline in user experience or even significant financial loss. Hence, a large amount of fault tolerance approaches have been proposed for SPSs. These approaches often have their own priorities on specific performance concerns, e.g., runtime overhead and recovery efficiency. Nevertheless, there is a lack of a systematic overview and classification of the state-of-the-art fault tolerance approaches in SPSs, which will become an obstacle for the development of SPSs. Therefore, we investigate the existing achievements and develop a taxonomy of the fault tolerance in SPSs. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation framework tailored for fault tolerance, demonstrate the experimental results on two representative open-sourced SPSs and exposit the possible disadvantages in current designs.

Su2022538,Quantitative Verification for Monitoring Event-Streaming Systems,"High-performance data streaming technologies are increasingly adopted in IT companies to support the integration of heterogeneous and possibly distributed applications. Compared with the traditional message queuing middleware, a streaming platform enables the implementation of event-streaming systems (ESS) which include not only complex queues but also pipelines that transform and react to the streams of data. By analysing the centralised data streams, one can evaluate the Quality-of-Service for other systems and components that produce or consume those streams. We consider the exploitation of probabilistic model checking as a performance monitoring technique for ESS systems. Probabilistic model checking is a mature, powerful verification technique with successful application in performance analysis. However, an ESS system may contain quantitative parameters that are determined by event streams observed in a certain period of time. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework called QV4M (meaning 'quantitative verification for monitoring') for monitoring ESS systems, which is based on two recent methods of probabilistic model checking. QV4M assumes the parameters in a probabilistic system model as random variables and infers the statistical significance for the probabilistic model checking output.

Löff2022,DSParLib: A C++ Template Library for Distributed Stream Parallelism,"Stream processing applications deal with millions of data items continuously generated over time. Often, they must be processed in real-time and scale performance, which requires the use of distributed parallel computing resources. In C/C++, the current state-of-the-art for distributed architectures and High-Performance Computing is Message Passing Interface (MPI). However, exploiting stream parallelism using MPI is complex and error-prone because it exposes many low-level details to the programmer. In this work, we introduce a new parallel programming abstraction for implementing distributed stream parallelism named DSParLib. Our abstraction of MPI simplifies parallel programming by providing a pattern-based and building block-oriented development to inter-connect, model, and parallelize data streams found in modern applications. Experiments conducted with five different stream processing applications and the representative PARSEC Ferret benchmark revealed that DSParLib is efficient and flexible. Also, DSParLib achieved similar or better performance, required less coding, and provided simpler abstractions to express parallelism with respect to handwritten MPI programs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Löff, J. and Hoffmann, R.B. and Pieper, R. and Griebler, D. and Fernandes, L.G.",2022,International Journal of Parallel Programming,10.1007/s10766-022-00737-2,scopus-search1.bib
Gu2022539,Meces: Latency-efficient Rescaling via Prioritized State Migration for Stateful Distributed Stream Processing Systems,"Stateful distributed stream processing engines (SPEs) usually call for dynamic rescaling due to varying workloads. However, existing state migration approaches suffer from latency spikes, or high resource usage, or major disruptions as they ignore the order of state migration during rescaling. This paper reveals the importance of state migration order to the latency performance in SPEs. Based on that, we propose Meces, an on-the-fly state migration mechanism which prioritizes the state migration of hot keys (those being processed or about to be processed by downstream operator tasks) to achieve smooth rescaling. Meces leverages a fetch-on-demand design which migrates operator states at record-granularity for state consistency. We further devise a hierarchical state data structure and gradual strategy for migration efficiency. Meces is implemented on Apache Flink and evaluated with diversified benchmarks and scenarios. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, Meces improves stream processing performance in terms of latency and throughput during rescaling by orders of magnitude, with negligible overhead and no disruption to non-rescaling periods. © 2022 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, ATC 2022.All rights reserved.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Gu, R. and Yin, H. and Zhong, W. and Yuan, C. and Huang, Y.",2022,"Proceedings of the 2022 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, ATC 2022",,scopus-search1.bib
Zhang202217,MicroStream: A Distributed In-memory Caching Service for Data Production,"Data-driven innovation and optimization have become an important direction for the intelligent transformation of enterprises. Data processing tasks have been developed and orchestrated to extract data insights, creating direct or indirect data dependencies between tasks or between tasks and the presentation layer. Traditional ETL (Extract-Transformation-Load) solutions share data through persistent storage, which has certain performance bottlenecks in hybrid cloud and multisource data scenarios. In this paper, we propose MicroStream, a distributed data virtualization and caching middleware service. MicroStream shields the direct access of ETL tasks to the storage layer and converts batch access to the source database into microstream access.

Verheijde20221314,S-QUERY: Opening the Black Box of Internal Stream Processor State,"Distributed streaming dataflow systems have evolved into scalable and fault-tolerant production-grade systems. Their applicability has departed from the mere analysis of streaming windows and complex-event processing, and now includes cloud applications and machine learning inference. Although the advancements in the state management of streaming systems have contributed significantly to their maturity, the internal state of streaming operators has been so far hidden from external applications. However, that internal state can be seen as a materialized view that can be used for analytics, monitoring, and debugging. In this paper we argue that exposing the internal state of streaming systems to outside applications by making it queryable, opens the road for novel use cases. To this end, we introduce S-QUERY: an approach and reference architecture where the state of stream processors can be queried - either live or through snapshots, achieving different isolation levels. We show how this new capability can be implemented in an existing open-source stream processor, and how queryable state can affect the performance of such a system. Our experimental evaluation suggests that the snapshot configuration adds only up to 8ms latency in the 99.99thpercentile and negligible increase in 0-90thpercentiles. © 2022 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Verheijde, J. and Karakoidas, V. and Fragkoulis, M. and Katsifodimos, A.",2022,Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering,10.1109/ICDE53745.2022.00103,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib
Raptis2022,On Efficiently Partitioning a Topic in Apache Kafka,"Apache Kafka addresses the general problem of delivering extreme high volume event data to diverse consumers via a publish-subscribe messaging system. It uses partitions to scale a topic across many brokers for producers to write data in parallel, and also to facilitate parallel reading of consumers. Even though Apache Kafka provides some out of the box optimizations, it does not strictly define how each topic shall be efficiently distributed into partitions. The well-formulated fine-Tuning that is needed in order to improve an Apache Kafka cluster performance is still an open research problem. In this paper, we first model the Apache Kafka topic partitioning process for a given topic. Then, given the set of brokers, constraints and application requirements on throughput, OS load, replication latency and unavailability, we formulate the optimization problem of finding how many partitions are needed and show that it is computationally intractable, being an integer program. Furthermore, we propose two simple, yet efficient heuristics to solve the problem: The first tries to minimize and the second to maximize the number of brokers used in the cluster. Finally, we evaluate its performance via largescale simulations, considering as benchmarks some Apache Kafka cluster configuration recommendations provided by Microsoft and Confluent. We demonstrate that, unlike the recommendations, the proposed heuristics respect the hard constraints on replication latency and perform better w.r.t. unavailability time and OS load, using the system resources in a more prudent way. © 2022 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Raptis, T.P. and Passarella, A.",2022,"Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems, CITS 2022",10.1109/CITS55221.2022.9832981,scopus-search1.bib
Chen20221427,Intelligent Live Video Streaming for Object Detection,"These days, sensors and cameras are being deployed on an increasingly large scale. Furthermore, the rapid development of machine learning models for computer vision now presents novel opportunities for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) combinations in various application scenarios. However, challenges remain in supporting low-latency video streaming from distributed mobile IoT devices under dynamic network environments, and overcoming video data quality degradation that results from weather 'noise', which reduces the accuracy of AI-based data analyses such as object detection. In this paper, we propose a live video stream processing system for supporting intelligent services that integrates the following features. First, to cope with dynamic networks and achieve low latency, our approach employs a peer-to-peer (P2P)-based virtual network at the edge and a multi-tiered architecture composed of IoT cameras, edge, and cloud servers. Second, we construct a flexible messaging system for video analysis built upon SINETStream, which is a messaging system that adopts a topic-based pub/sub model. Third, we implement a framework that can remove weather-related (rain, snow, and fog) noise by applying weather classification and adaptive noise removal models that improve the accuracy of video analysis from data collected outdoors. The latency, throughput, and image quality benchmark experiments conducted to validate the feasibility of our proposed system showed that the process resulted in image quality improvements of approximately 30% (on average). © 2021 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Chen, M. and Sun, J. and Aida, K. and Figueiredo, R.J. and Ku, Y.-J. and Subratie, K.",2021,"2021 IEEE 23rd International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications, 7th International Conference on Data Science and Systems, 19th International Conference on Smart City and 7th International Conference on Dependability in Sensor, Cloud and Big Data Systems and Applications, HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys 2021",10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00214,scopus-search1.bib;ieee1-search1.bib
Vyas2022465,Performance Evaluation of Apache Kafka-A Modern Platform for Real Time Data Streaming,"Current generation businesses become more demanding on timely availability of data. Many real-time data streaming tools and technologies are capable to meet business expectations. Apache Kafka is one of the capable open-source distributed scalable technology that enables real-time data streaming with good throughput and latency. In traditional batch processing, data is getting processed in groups or batches but in streaming services, data records are handled separately and there is a flow of data processing that is continuous and real-time. Once Data is available at the source, Kafka can detect and stream it in real-time to the target application. After doing the literature survey it was observed that there are insufficient experiments have been done till now with a variety of volumes and with different values of the number of partitions and polling intervals. The purpose of this study is to elaborate on Apache Kafka implementation and evaluate its performance. This study will analyse key performance indicators for the streaming platform and will provide useful insights from it. These insights will help to design optimized applications in Apache Kafka. Based on gaps identified after the literature survey, multiple experiments have been conducted for the producer and consumer API (Application Programming interface). Configuration of Kafka with Apache Zookeeper helped to drive the results which are captured in tabular form for different values of polling intervals, volumes, and partitions. Data for all test runs have been analysed further to drive the conclusions as mentioned in the results section. This study provides valuable insights about the utilization of CPU (Central Processing Unit) and memory for Apache Kafka streaming on changing volumes, also elaborates the impacts on streaming performance when key configurations are getting changed. © 2022 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,INCLUDED,INCLUDED,EXCLUDED,short paper w/ experiments on a single machine,"Vyas, S. and Tyagi, R.K. and Jain, C. and Sahu, S.",2022,"Proceedings of 2nd International Conference on Innovative Practices in Technology and Management, ICIPTM 2022",10.1109/ICIPTM54933.2022.9754154,scopus-search1.bib
Mebrek2022516,A Multi-agent Based Framework for RDF Stream Processing,"When a large amount of data is generated from multiple, heterogeneous and continuous data streams, the need for continuous processing and on-the-fly consumption of the overwhelming flow of data is crucial. In this context, the W3C RDF Stream Processing (RSP) Community Group has defined a common model for continuous querying RDF Streams, giving rise to a plethora of RSP engines. However, their main limitation is that, depending on the application queries, one RSP engine may be more appropriate than another, or multiple engines are required to address complex queries. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent based framework for distributed continuous processing that gives the opportunity to use several RSP engines in the same framework in order to benefit from their advantages and to offer the possibility to use them at the same time or in a sequence to answer complex queries.

Lu2022133,"AutoFlow: Hotspot-Aware, Dynamic Load Balancing for Distributed Stream Processing","Stream applications are widely deployed on the cloud. While modern distributed streaming systems like Flink and Spark Streaming can schedule and execute them efficiently, streaming dataflows are often dynamically changing, which may cause computation imbalance and backpressure. We introduce AutoFlow, an automatic, hotspot-aware dynamic load balance system for streaming dataflows. It incorporates a centralized scheduler that monitors the load balance in the entire dataflow dynamically and implements state migrations correspondingly. The scheduler achieves these two tasks using a simple asynchronous distributed control message mechanism and a hotspot-diminishing algorithm. The timing mechanism supports implicit barriers and a highly efficient state-migration without global barriers or pauses to operators. It also supports a time-window based load-balance measurement and feeds them to the hotspot-diminishing algorithm without user interference. We implemented AutoFlow on top of Ray, an actor-based distributed execution framework. Our evaluation based on various streaming benchmark datasets shows that AutoFlow achieves good load-balance and incurs a low latency overhead in a highly data-skew workload. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Lu, P. and Yue, Y. and Yuan, L. and Zhang, Y.",2022,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10.1007/978-3-030-95391-1_9,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib
Sharkova202296,Adaptive SQL Query Optimization in Distributed Stream Processing: A Preliminary Study,"Distributed stream processing is widely adopted for real-time data analysis and management. SQL is becoming a common language for robust streaming analysis due to the introduction of time-varying relations and event time semantics. However, query optimization in state-of-the-art stream processing engines (SPEs) remains limited: runtime adjustments to execution plans are not applied. This fact restricts the optimization capabilities because SPEs lack the statistical data properties before query execution begins. Moreover, streaming queries are often long-lived, and these properties can change over time. Adaptive optimization, used in databases for queries with insufficient or unknown data statistics, can fit the streaming scenario. In this work, we explore the main challenges that SPEs face during the adjustment of adaptive optimization, such as predicting statistical properties of streams and execution graph migration. We demonstrate potential performance gains of our approach within an extension of the NEXMark streaming benchmark and outline our further work. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Sharkova, D. and Chernokoz, A. and Trofimov, A. and Sokolov, N. and Gorshkova, E. and Kuralenok, I. and Novikov, B.",2022,Communications in Computer and Information Science,10.1007/978-3-030-93849-9_7,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib
Tu2022207,Research on Heterogeneous Accelerated Columnar Storage Engine Based on Co- optimization of Software and Hardware for GoldenX [面向GoldenX软硬协同优化的异构加速列式存储引擎研究],"In the era of Internet of Everything, with the emergence of various new computing technologies and emerging application fields, the traditional data processing methods are gradually evolving from a single processing method to a cloud-edge collaborative data processing method. The complex and changeable ecosystem (including multi-cloud and multi-edge) on the cloud and edge sides have brought rapid growth in data scale, complex data locations and load connections. Under this premise, how to efficiently and stably access data and information and how to speed up data query processing has become a key issue that academia and industry need to solve urgently. On the other hand, the new hardware technologies represented by GPU (graphic process unit) / FPGA (field programmable gate array) heterogeneous computing power, NVM (non-volatile memory) storage, and RDMA(remote direct memory access) network, is developing and applying rapidly. This will have a revolutionary impact on the existing software architecture system, and also provide a foundation for the evolution and performance improvement of the database system, and attract the attention from more and more researchers. Therefore, how to use these emerging new hardware technologies to empower the real database system used in the industry has become one of the current research hotspots. First of all, this paper introduces the architecture of ZTE GoldenX database system and the design of its columnar storage engine, and then focuses on the software and hardware co-design and optimization of the GoldenX's columnar storage engine using new hardware features at the computing layers and storage layers. The main work and contributions include: (1) Offload the tasks of compression/decompression and encryption/decryption from the CPU to the FPGA, and use the programmable characteristics of FPGA to design a dedicated MISD (multiple instruction stream single data stream) architecture processor, adopting ""software interface level-computing core level-functional module level"" three stage pipeline design to improve the efficiency of data stream processing; (2) Customize a vectorized execution engine for GoldenX's column storage to make full use of the new features of CPU/GPU namely SIMD (single instruction multiple data) to optimize the traditional volcano model, reducing the cost of function calls; (3) Optimize the SQL execution engine, dynamically evaluate and utilize GPU computing resources, and use the JIT compilation technology to push statistical and analysis SQL operation tasks with matrix computing characteristics (such as filtering/sorting/aggregation) down to the GPU, so that the ultra-high parallel computing powers of the GPU can be used to improve SQL query and analysis performance. Our experiments show that the software and hardware optimization method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the system performance of GoldenX. Using FPGA for compression/decompression operations can improve read and write performance by 1.2~2.4 times, and after offloading scanning/connection/grouping operations to GPU, their execution time can be reduced by 33%~92%, and after the vectorization engine is turned on, the execution time of SCAN/AGG/JOIN is reduced by 41%~83%. Finally, we conducted a system-level test on the database, among the 22 queries in the TPC-H benchmark test scenario, the system performance after optimization is 2.5~10 times higher than that before optimization. Compared with openGauss with vectorization turned on, the optimized GoldenX reduces the execution time by 17%~78%. © 2022, Science Press.

Cattermole2021,Run-time adaptation of stream processing spanning the cloud and the edge,"Applications that process streams of events generated by sensors are important in a wide range of domains. It is now common to distribute stream processing across edge devices and the cloud. This exploits processing power near the sensors, reducing the load on the cloud and often the required network bandwidth. In this paper we focus on one challenge in distributed stream processing: automatically adapting the partitioning of the processing between the edge and the cloud without a loss of service. An example is when the event arrival rate increases and the edge processor can no longer meet performance requirements. Re-partitioning without loss of service involves moving computations between the edge and the cloud while events are still being processed. In this paper we describe StrIoT - a stream processing system that supports automatic re-partitioning. It is based on a set of functional stream operators, and the paper describes how the run-time system can automatically adapt applications that use them. A key feature is support for the fission and fusion of operators during adaptations. Performance evaluation shows that StrIoT can move parts of a stream processing application between the cloud and edge with only a low, temporary impact on performance. © 2021 ACM.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Cattermole, A. and Dowland, J. and Watson, P.",2021,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,10.1145/3492323.3495627,scopus-search1.bib
Matesanz2021,Demand-driven data acquisition for large scale fleets,"Automakers manage vast fleets of connected vehicles and face an ever-increasing demand for their sensor readings. This demand originates from many stakeholders, each potentially requiring different sensors from different vehicles. Currently, this demand remains largely unfulfilled due to a lack of systems that can handle such diverse demands efficiently. Vehicles are usually passive participants in data acquisition, each continuously reading and transmitting the same static set of sensors. However, in a multi-tenant setup with diverse data demands, each vehicle potentially needs to provide different data instead. We present a system that performs such vehicle-specific minimization of data acquisition by mapping individual data demands to individual vehicles. We collect personal data only after prior consent and fulfill the requirements of the GDPR. Non-personal data can be collected by directly addressing individual vehicles. The system consists of a software component natively integrated with a major automaker’s vehicle platform and a cloud platform brokering access to acquired data. Sensor readings are either provided via near real-time streaming or as recorded trip files that provide specific consistency guarantees. A performance evaluation with over 200,000 simulated vehicles has shown that our system can increase server capacity on-demand and process streaming data within 269 ms on average during peak load. The resulting architecture can be used by other automakers or operators of large sensor networks. Native vehicle integration is not mandatory; the architecture can also be used with retrofitted hardware such as OBD readers. © 2021 by the authors.

Sarathchandra2021,Resource aware scheduler for distributed stream processing in cloud native environments,"Recently distributed stream processors are increasingly being deployed in cloud computing infrastructures. In this article, we study performance characteristics of distributed stream processing applications in Google Compute Engine which is based on Kubernetes. We identify performance gaps in terms of throughput which appear in such environments when using a round robin (RR) scheduling algorithm. As a solution, we propose resource aware stream processing scheduler called resource aware scheduler for stream processing applications in cloud native environments (RaspaCN). We implement RaspaCN's job scheduler using two-step process. First, we use machine learning to identify the optimal number of worker nodes. Second, we use RR and multiple Knapsack algorithms to produce performance optimal stream processing job schedules. With three application benchmarks called HTTP Log Processor, Nexmark, and Email Processor representing real world stream processing scenarios we evaluate the performance benefits obtained via RaspaCN's scheduling algorithm. RaspaCN could produce percentage increase of average throughput values by at least 37%, 38%, and 10%, respectively, for HTTP Log Processor, Nexmark, and Email Processor benchmarks for fixed input data rates. Furthermore, we conduct experiments with varying input data rates as well and show 7% improved average throughput for HTTP Log Processor.

Multiple types of computer architectures offer a wide range of possibilities when addressing the needs of computer vision technologies. When it comes to real time processing for high level and complex event detections, however, some limitations may arise, such as the computing power in the edge or the cost of sending real time video to the cloud for running advanced algorithms. In this paper, we present a functional architecture of a complete video surveillance solution and we focus on the metadata-processing event engine which takes care of the high-level video processing that is decoupled from a low-level video analysis. The low-level video analysis running in the edge generates and publishes a flow of JSON messages structure containing the details of bounding boxes detected in each frame into an asynchronous messaging service.

Stefani2021,Tiered Sampling: An Efficient Method for Counting Sparse Motifs in Massive Graph Streams,"We introduce Tiered Sampling, a novel technique for estimating the count of sparse motifs in massive graphs whose edges are observed in a stream. Our technique requires only a single pass on the data and uses a memory of fixed size M, which can be magnitudes smaller than the number of edges. Our methods address the challenging task of counting sparse motifs - sub-graph patterns - that have a low probability of appearing in a sample of M edges in the graph, which is the maximum amount of data available to the algorithms in each step. To obtain an unbiased and low variance estimate of the count, we partition the available memory into tiers (layers) of reservoir samples. While the base layer is a standard reservoir sample of edges, other layers are reservoir samples of sub-structures of the desired motif. By storing more frequent sub-structures of the motif, we increase the probability of detecting an occurrence of the sparse motif we are counting, thus decreasing the variance and error of the estimate. While we focus on the designing and analysis of algorithms for counting 4-cliques, we present a method which allows generalizing Tiered Sampling to obtain high-quality estimates for the number of occurrence of any sub-graph of interest, while reducing the analysis effort due to specific properties of the pattern of interest. We present a complete analytical analysis and extensive experimental evaluation of our proposed method using both synthetic and real-world data. Our results demonstrate the advantage of our method in obtaining high-quality approximations for the number of 4 and 5-cliques for large graphs using a very limited amount of memory, significantly outperforming the single edge sample approach for counting sparse motifs in large scale graphs. © 2021 ACM.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Stefani, L.D. and Terolli, E. and Upfal, E.",2021,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data,10.1145/3441299,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;acm1-search1.bib

Park2021,Development of Boiling Prediction Method in LP-EGR Cooler and Shape Optimization for Suppressing Boiling using Boiling Index,"An EGR system has been significantly used in order to cope with reinforced exhaust gas regulation and enhancement of fuel efficiency. For the well-designed EGR cooler, performance analysis is basically required. Furthermore, boiling prediction of the EGR cooler is especially essential to evaluate durability failure of abnormal operating conditions in DPF. However, due to intrinsic complexity of detailed 3-dimensional heat transfer tubes in the EGR cooler, no precise technique of boiling prediction has been developed. Therefore, this research had been performed in order to fulfill 3 goals: (1) development of 3-dimentional performance prediction technique including boiling occurrence, (2) generation and validation of a new evaluation index for boiling, (3) development of an optimized EGR cooler for suppressing boiling. In order to increase analysis accuracy and reduce analysis efforts at the same time, 3-dimensional single-phase flow analysis was developed. This technique was applied to LP-EGR cooler design of the next generation smart stream engine of HMC. Rig test results were used to validate this newly developed analysis method. Especially, in order to predict global system boiling, a new evaluation boiling index was introduced. It was defined as ratio of boiling heat transfer to total heat transfer and showed good behavior. For shape optimization, the boiling index was evaluated with 12 operating points. A base design showed poor distribution of coolant flow caused local boiling and system boiling when it gets worse. In order to achieve well distributed coolant flow and suppressing boiling, 43 different baffles were investigated using the boiling index. The shape optimized EGR cooler showed 32% reduction of boiling index and slight increment of cooling efficiency compared to base EGR cooler. Additional rig test of the optimized EGR cooler was performed to validate correlation and consistency and demonstrated good feasibility of the new method and the boiling index. © 2021 SAE International.

Kang2021126,SLO-aware Virtual Rebalancing for Edge Stream Processing,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled an abundance of geographically distributed physical devices or 'things' equipped with sensors and actuators to exchange information with the Cloud. However, this paradigm remains largely under-exploited for real-time analytic applications. The benefit of realtime data acquisition at the Edge becomes fruitless as it is not readily accessible to more powerful data analytic tools in the Cloud due to wide-area network delays. In this paper, we present VRebalance, a virtual resource orchestrator that provides an end-to-end performance guarantee for concurrent stream processing workloads at the Edge. VRebalance employs Bayesian Optimization $\mathcal{BO}$ to quickly identify near-optimal resource configurations. Experimental results with a real-time open-source IoT benchmark for Distributed Stream Processing Platforms (RIoTBench) and a representative stream processing engine (Apache Storm) demonstrate the superior performance, resource efficiency and adaptiveness of our $\mathcal{BO}$-based resource management system.

Gomes20213069,Railgun: Managing large streaming windows under mad requirements,"Some mission critical systems, e.g., fraud detection, require accurate, real-time metrics over long time sliding windows on applications that demand high throughput and low latencies. As these applications need to run “forever” and cope with large, spiky data loads, they further require to be run in a distributed setting. We are unaware of any streaming system that provides all those properties. Instead, existing systems take large simplifications, such as implementing sliding windows as a fixed set of overlapping windows, jeopardizing metric accuracy (violating regulatory rules) or latency (breaching service agreements). In this paper, we propose Railgun, a fault-tolerant, elastic, and distributed streaming system supporting real-time sliding windows for scenarios requiring high loads and millisecond-level latencies. We benchmarked an initial prototype of Railgun using real data, showing significant lower latency than Flink and low memory usage independent of window size. Further, we show that Railgun scales nearly linearly, respecting our msec-level latencies at high percentiles (<250ms @ 99.9%) even under a load of 1 million events per second. © The authors.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Gomes, A.S. and Oliveirinha, J. and Cardoso, P. and Bizarro, P.",2021,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,10.14778/3476311.3476384,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;acm2-search1.bib
Daghistani2021_92,Guard: Attack-Resilient Adaptive Load Balancing in Distributed Streaming Systems,"The performance of distributed streaming systems relies on how even the workload is distributed among their machines. However, data and query workloads are skewed and change rapidly. Therefore, multiple adaptive load-balancing mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to rebalance distributed streaming systems according to the changes in their workloads. This paper introduces a novel attack model that targets adaptive load-balancing mechanisms of distributed streaming systems. The attack reduces the throughput and the availability of the system by making it stay in a continuous state of rebalancing. This paper proposes Guard, a component that detects and blocks attacks that target the adaptive load balancing of distributed streaming systems. Guard uses an unsupervised machine-learning technique to detect malicious users that are involved in the attack. Guard does not block any user unless it detects that the user is malicious. Guard does not depend on a specific application. Experimental evaluation for a high-intensity attack illustrates that Guard improves the throughput and the availability of the system by 85% and 86%, respectively. Moreover, Guard improves the minimum availability that the attacker achieves by 325%.

Aiming to make fair comparisons of different SPEs raises this bar even higher. One important reason for this challenge is the fact that these systems often use concepts that require expert knowledge for each SPE. To address this issue, we present Expose, a distributed performance evaluation framework for SPEs that enables a user through a declarative approach to specify experiments and conduct them on multiple SPEs in a fair way and with low effort. Experimenters with few technical skills can define and execute distributed experiments that can easily be replicated.

Poeira2021143,Deconstructing yield operator to enhance streams processing,"Customizing streams pipelines with new user-defined operations is a well-known pattern regarding streams processing. However, programming languages face two challenges when considering streams extensibility: 1) provide a compact and readable way to express new operations, and 2) keep streams’ laziness behavior. From here, we may find a consensus around the adoption of the generator operator, i.e. yield, as a means to fulfil both requirements, since most state-of-the-art programming languages provide this feature. Yet, what is the performance overhead of interleaving a yield-based operation in streams processing? In this work we present a benchmark based on realistic use cases of two different web APIs, namely: Last.fm and world weather online, where custom yield-based operations may degrade the streams performance in twofold. We also propose a purely functional and minimalistic design, named tinyield, that can be easily adopted in any programming language and provides a concise way of chaining extension operations fluently, with low overhead in the evaluated benchmarks. The tinyield proposal was deployed in three different libraries, namely for Java (jayield), JavaScript (tinyield4ts) and .Net (tinyield4net).

Son202161,A benchmark test for stateless stream partitioning over distributed network environments,"Distributed stream processing engines (DSPEs) provides various stateless stream partitioning to select the receiver tasks for each message regardless of the data fields. A representative DSPE, Apache Storm, provides the polarized stateless stream partitioning: Shuffle grouping considering the fairness only and Local-or-Shuffle grouping considering the locality only. The recently proposed Locality Aware grouping is a novel technique to solve this polarization. However, it is difficult to select an appropriate stream partitioning method considering various configurations of distributed stream applications, network capacity, and data size. In this paper, we benchmark the stateless stream partitioning methods from the perspective of different network bandwidths. To change bandwidths, we experiment on the most widely used the usual Ethernet equipment and the recent InfiniBand, a high-performance network equipment.

Stein20202207,Smart Resource Management for Data Streaming using an Online Bin-packing Strategy,"Data stream processing frameworks provide reliable and efficient mechanisms for executing complex workflows over large datasets. A common challenge for the majority of currently available streaming frameworks is efficient utilization of resources. Most frameworks use static or semi-static settings for resource utilization that work well for established use cases but lead to marginal improvements for unseen scenarios. Another pressing issue is the efficient processing of large individual objects such as images and matrices typical for scientific datasets. HarmonicIO has proven to be a good solution for streams of relatively large individual objects, as demonstrated in a benchmark comparison with the Apache Spark and Kafka streaming frameworks. We here present an extension of the HarmonicIO framework based on the online bin-packing algorithm.

Harwood20201344,"Dragon: A lightweight, high performance distributed stream processing engine","—The performance of a distributed stream processing engine is traditionally considered in terms of fundamental measurements of latency and throughput. Recently, Apache Storm has demonstrated sub-millisecond latencies for inter-component tuple transmission, though it does so through aggressive throttling that leads to strict throughput limitations in order to keep tuple queues near empty. On the other hand, Apache Heron has excellent throughput characteristics, especially when operating near unstable conditions, but its inter-component latencies typically start around 10 milliseconds. Both of these systems require roughly 650MB of installation space. We have developed Dragon, loosely based on the same API as Storm and Heron, that is both lightweight, requiring just 7.5MB of installation space, and competitive in performance to Storm and Heron. In this paper we show experiments with all three systems using the Word Count benchmark. Dragon achieves throughput characteristics near to that of Heron and inter-component latencies less than 10ms under high load. In particular, Dragon’s maximum latency is significantly less that Storm’s maximum latency under high load. Finally Dragon managed to remain stable at higher effective throughput than Heron. We believe Dragon is a good “all-rounder” solution and is particularly suitable for Edge computing applications, given its small installation footprint. ©2020 IEEE",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,INCLUDED,INCLUDED,EXCLUDED,"the experiments are only a classical word count app, and the interesting ones are executed in a single machine","Harwood, A. and Read, M.R. and Amarasinghe, G.N.",2020,Proceedings - International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems,10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00177,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee1-search1.bib

Wang2020101,Evaluating Fault Tolerance of Distributed Stream Processing Systems,"Since failures in large-scale clusters can lead to severe performance degradation and break system availability, fault tolerance is critical for distributed stream processing systems (DSPSs). Plenty of fault tolerance approaches have been proposed over the last decade. However, there is no systematic work to evaluate and compare them in detail. Previous work either evaluates global performance during failure-free runtime, or merely measures throughout loss when failure happens. In this paper, it is the first work proposing an evaluation framework customized for quantitatively comparing runtime overhead and recovery efficiency of fault tolerance mechanisms in DSPSs. We define three typical configurable workloads, which are widely-adopted in previous DSPS evaluations. We construct five workload suites based on three workloads to investigate the effects of different factors on fault tolerance performance.

Li2019202,A holistic stream partitioning algorithm for distributed stream processing systems,"The performances of modern distributed stream processing systems are critically affected by the distribution of the load across workers. Skewed data streams in real world are very common and pose a great challenge to these systems, especially for stateful applications. Key splitting, which allows a single key to be routed to multiple workers, is a great idea to achieve good balance of load in the cluster. However, it comes with the cost of increased memory consumption and computation overhead as well as network communication. In this paper, we present a new definition of metric to model the cost of key splitting for intra-operator parallelism in stream processing systems and provide a novel perspective to reduce replication factor while keeping both overall load imbalance and processing latency low. Similar to previous work, our approach treats the head and the tail of the distribution differently in order to reduce memory requirements. For the head, it uses our proposed notion of regional load imbalance to decide dynamically whether to make one more worker responsible for the heavy hitter or not. For the tail, it simply uses hash partitioning to keep the size of the routing table for the head as small as possible. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach provides superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art partitioning algorithms in terms of load imbalance, replication factor and latency over different levels of skewed stream distributions. © 2019 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Li, K. and Liu, G. and Lu, M.",2019,"Proceedings - 2019 20th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies, PDCAT 2019",10.1109/PDCAT46702.2019.00046,scopus-search1.bib;ieee1-search1.bib
Prasaad2019,Scaling ordered stream processing on shared-memory multicores,"Many modern applications require realtime processing of large volumes of high speed data. Such data processing can be specified in the form of a dataflow graph that exposes multiple opportunities for parallelizing its execution, in the form of data, pipeline and task parallelism. This paper focuses on the problem of effectively parallelizing ordered streaming computations by exploiting low overhead, shared memory parallelism on a multicore machine. We propose an adaptive runtime that dynamically maps the exposed parallelism in a streaming computation to that of the machine using scheduling heuristics. Further, we address some key problems in effectively realizing ordered data parallelism. We propose a new approach for parallelizing partitioned stateful operators that can handle load imbalance across partitions effectively and mostly avoid delays due to ordering constraints. We also present a low latency, non-blocking concurrent data structure to order outputs produced by concurrent workers on an operator.

Shah2019361,Performance comparison of chunk and peer scheduling algorithms of peer-To-peer streaming systems,"With increasing popularity of Peer to Peer systems for video streaming, it is important that the expectations of the users regarding the quality of such systems are being met. In a P2P system, the media stream is divided into small data units known as chunks. Each peer in a Peer to Peer (P2P) system has to take two important decisions at a given time. First, which chunks are to be shared and second with which peer. This paper compares the performance of different combinations of chunk/peer schedulers in terms of chunk diffusion delay, average chunk distribution delay and max chunk distribution delay. By doing so, the best possible combination of the two schedulers for the given experimental setup is explored. The results obtained under the specified experimental setup show that when chunk scheduling algorithm Deadline Based Chunk Scheduler (DLc) is combined with different peer scheduling algorithms, the best results are obtained by its combination with Chunk Earliest Free Pair Scheduler (CEFp).

The solution builds upon the ParCorr parallel method for online correlation discovery and is designed to run continuously on top of the UPM-CEP data streaming engine through efficient streaming operators. The implementation takes advantage of the flexible API of the streaming engine that provides low level primitives for developing custom operators. Thus, each operator is implemented to process incoming tuples on-the-fly and hence emit resulting tuples as early as possible.

Pohl2019267,Adaptive Partitioning and Order-Preserved Merging of Data Streams,"Partitioning is a key concept for utilizing modern hardware, especially to exploit parallelism opportunities from many-core CPUs. In data streaming scenarios where parameters like tuple arrival rates can vary, adaptive strategies for partitioning solve the problem of overestimating or underestimating query workloads. While there are many possibilities to partition the data flow, threads running partitions independently from each other lead to unordered output inevitably. This is a considerable difficulty for applications where tuple order matters, like in stream reasoning or complex event processing scenarios. In this paper, we address this problem by combining an adaptive partitioning approach with an order-preserving merge algorithm. Since reordering output tuples can only worsen latency, we mainly focus on the throughput of queries while keeping the delay on individual tuples minimal.

Gradvohl201848,Metrics and tool for evaluating data stream processing systems,"With the Internet of Things and many other data sources continuously generating events, service providers who analyze these data need fast and flexible software. These software, called data stream processing systems, can be created from scratch or, as is more often the case today, use frameworks that already implement many of the functionality required for stream processing. In fact, programmers implement these software as distributed systems today because they need frameworks to deal with huge, fast and high throughput streams. That is the reason why a centralized system would hardly be able to handle data streams without eventually discarding some events. Therefore, it is important that, before putting a data stream processing system in production, we can simulate the scenarios that this system will handle and analyze its behavior. In this sense, this paper presents the general characteristics of the data stream processing systems, as well as some of the main metrics for the analysis of this sort of system.

Kuo2018179,Critical task scheduling for data stream computing on heterogeneous clouds,"Internet of Things is an emerging paradigm to enable easy data collection and exchange among a wide variety of devices. When the scale of Internet of Things enlarges, the cloud computing system could be applied to mine these big data generated by Internet of Things. This paper proposes a task scheduling approach for time-critical data streaming applications on heterogeneous clouds. The proposed approach takes the tasks in critical stages into consideration, and re-schedules these tasks to appropriate resources to shorten their processing time. In general, selecting the time-critical task to give more resources may remove the execution bottleneck. A small-scale cloud system including 3 servers is built for experiments. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by three micro-benchmarks. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the performance improvement of the critical task scheduling approach. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Kuo, Y.-H. and Lee, Y.-H. and Huang, K.-C. and Lai, K.-C.",2018,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,10.1007/978-981-10-7398-4_19,scopus-search1.bib
Gkolemis2018157,Automatic scaling of resources in a storm topology,"In the Big Data era, the batch processing of large volumes of data is simply not enough - data needs to be processed fast to support continuous reactions to changing conditions in real-time. Distributed stream processing systems have emerged as platforms of choice for applications that rely on real-time analytics, with Apache Storm [2] being one of the most prevalent representatives. Whether deployed on physical or virtual infrastructures, distributed stream processing systems are expected to make the most out of the available resources, i.e., achieve the highest throughput or lowest latency with the minimum resource utilisation. However, for Storm - as for most such systems - this is a cumbersome trial-and-error procedure, tied to the specific workload that needs to be processed and requiring manual tweaking of resource-related topology parameters. To this end, we propose ARiSTO, a system that automatically decides on the appropriate amount of resources to be provisioned for each node of the Storm workflow topology based on user-defined performance and cost constraints. ARiSTO employs two mechanisms: a static, model-based one, used at bootstrap time to predict the resource-related parameters that better fit the user needs and a dynamic, rule-based one that elastically auto-scales the allocated resources in order to maintain the desired performance even under changes in load. The experimental evaluation of our prototype proves the ability of ARiSto to efficiently decide on the resource-related configuration parameters, maintaining the desired throughput at all times. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Gkolemis, E. and Doka, K. and Koziris, N.",2018,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10.1007/978-3-319-74875-7_10,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib

Gad2016569,Local programming language barriers in stream-based systems,"Stream-based data processing systems, such as Complex Event Processing or data stream mining systems, may be composed of several components which may be implemented in various programming languages. In distributed scenarios, computer networks typically represent important bottlenecks. However, the performance of data exchange in local contexts may be as important as the performance of data exchange via computer networks. Local programming language barriers may represent important bottlenecks for components that are located on the same computer system. In distributed scenarios, it may be beneficial to relocate components on a single physical host for exploiting the higher local data throughput. The properties of stream-based systems pose challenges like high throughput requirements but also open up optimization potential such as leveraging batched transfers. We performed an experimental analysis of ways for bridging local programming language barriers using the examples of C, Java, and Python and analyzed the impact of batched forwarding. While local data exchange can be expected to offer a higher throughput than exchange across networks, our results show that batch forwarding can increase the local throughput by factors of up to 47.6 and we measured net throughputs up to 39.5 Gbps. © 2016 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Gad, R. and Kappes, M. and Medina-Bulo, I.",2016,Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications,10.1109/ISCC.2016.7543798,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib

Yet supporting high-performance event processing has become increasingly difficult due to the increasing size and complexity of event pattern workloads. In this work, we propose the SPASS framework that leverages time-based event correlations among queries for sharing computation tasks among sequence queries in a workload. We show the NP-hardness of our CEP pattern sharing problem by reducing it from the Minimum Substring Cover problem. The SPASS system finds a shared pattern plan in polynomial-time covering all sequence patterns while still guaranteeing an optimality bound. Further, the SPASS system assures concurrent maintenance and reuse of sub-patterns in the shared pattern plan.

Gudumasu2016,Layer-based buffer aware rate adaptation design for SHVC video streaming,"This paper proposes a layer based buffer aware rate adaptation design which is able to avoid abrupt video quality fluctuation, reduce re-buffering latency and improve bandwidth utilization when compared to a conventional simulcast based adaptive streaming system. The proposed adaptation design schedules DASH segment requests based on the estimated bandwidth, dependencies among video layers and layer buffer fullness. Scalable HEVC video coding is the latest state-of-art video coding technique that can alleviate various issues caused by simulcast based adaptive video streaming. With scalable coded video streams, the video is encoded once into a number of layers representing different qualities and/or resolutions: a base layer (BL) and one or more enhancement layers (EL), each incrementally enhancing the quality of the lower layers. Such layer based coding structure allows fine granularity rate adaptation for the video streaming applications. Two video streaming use cases are presented in this paper. The first use case is to stream HD SHVC video over a wireless network where available bandwidth varies, and the performance comparison between proposed layer-based streaming approach and conventional simulcast streaming approach is provided. The second use case is to stream 4K/UHD SHVC video over a hybrid access network that consists of a 5G millimeter wave high-speed wireless link and a conventional wired or WiFi network. The simulation results verify that the proposed layer based rate adaptation approach is able to utilize the bandwidth more efficiently. As a result, a more consistent viewing experience with higher quality video content and minimal video quality fluctuations can be presented to the user. © 2016 SPIE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Gudumasu, S. and Hamza, A. and Asbun, E. and He, Y. and Ye, Y.",2016,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1117/12.2235795,scopus-search1.bib;web-of-science-search1.bib

Apache Storm is a popular distributed real time stream processing engine which has been widely adopted by key players in the industry including YAHOO and Twitter. An application running in storm is called a topology that is characterized by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). To run multiple of such topologies in a storm cluster, storm provides with default, out of the box scheduler called Isolation Scheduler. Isolation Scheduler assigns resources to topologies based on static resource configuration and does not provide any means to prioritize topologies based on their varying business priority. As a result, performance degradation, even complete starvation of topologies with high business priority is possible when available cluster resources are insufficient. A priority based resource scheduling strategy is proposed in this paper to overcome this problem.

To ensure reliable performance, the most efficient way is to subject those VoD streaming networks to large-scale, realistic performance evaluations. Our previous Shadow Stream system is a production Internet live streaming network with performance evaluation as a built-in capability. In this paper, we extend the same idea into the VoD services. There exists significant difference between live and VoD, hence Shadow Stream cannot be directly used in VoD context. Firstly, clients in P2PVoD service are not synchronized in viewing progress, secondly, in VoD there exists interactive operations (e.g., Pause and drag), thirdly, the different play points of users also bring difficulty to replacing departed real clients.

This is done by exploiting data parallelism in existing algorithms. However, programming in a data-parallel fashion imposes extra burdens to programmers, who are used to writing sequential programs. New programming models and frameworks are needed to reach a balance between programmability, portability and performance.

Chen2010709,Data stream analytics as cloud service for mobile applications,"Many mobile applications are based on cloud services such as location service, messaging service, etc. Currently most cloud services are based on statically prepared information rather than the real-time analytics results of dynamically captured events. A paradigm shift is to take Continuous Stream Analytics (CSA) as a cloud service, which, however, poses several specific challenges in scalability, latency, time-window semantics and transaction control. In this work we extend the SQL query engine to unify the processing of static relations and dynamic streams for providing the platform support of CSA service. This platform is significantly differentiated from the current generation of stream processing systems which are in general built separately from the database engine thus unable to take advantage of the functionalities already offered by the existing data management technology, and suffer from the overhead of inter-platform data access and movement. To capture the window semantics in CSA, we introduce the cycle-based query model and support it in terms of the cut-and-rewind query execution mechanism. This mechanism allows a SQL query to run cycle by cycle for processing the unbounded stream data chunk by chunk, but without shutting the query instance down between chunks for continuously maintaining the application state across the execution cycles, as required by sliding-window oriented operations. We also propose the cycle-based transaction model with cycle-based isolation and visibility. To scale-up analytics computation, we introduce the parallel infrastructure with multi-engines cooperated and synchronized based the common data chunking criteria without centralized coordination. To scale-up service provisioning, we investigate how to stage the continuously generated analytics results efficiently through metadata manipulation without physical data moving and copying. We have prototyped our approach by extending the PostgreSQL, resulting in a new kind of tightly integrated, highly efficient platform for providing CSA service. We tested the throughput and latency of this service using a well-known stream processing benchmark and with WebOS based Palm phones. The test results show that the proposed approach is highly competitive.

Wireless video streaming applications are characterized by their bandwidth-intensity, delay-sensitivity, and loss-tolerance. Our main contributions include: (i) an analytical expression for packet delay and play-out deadline of unequal erasure protection (UXP) protected scalable video, (ii) an analysis of the performance of delay-aware, capacity-aware rate allocation for optimized UXP streaming scenarios, (iii) proof that unequal error protection causes a rate-constrained optimization problem to be non-convex. Performance evaluations using a 3GPP network simulator show that, for different channel capacities and packet loss rates, delay-aware non-stationary rate-allocation delivers significant gains which range between 1.65dB to 2dB in average Y-PSNR of the received video streams over delay-unaware strategies. These gains come at a cost of increased off-line computation which is performed prior to the streaming session and therefore, do not affect the run-time performance of the streaming system. © 2008 IEEE.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Mansour, H. and Krishnamurthy, V. and Nasiopoulos, P.",2008,IWCMC 2008 - International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference,10.1109/IWCMC.2008.83,scopus-search1.bib
Chan2008263,An efficient disk-array-based server design for a multicast video streaming system,"Recently, new Video-on-Demand (VoD) architectures using batching, patching and periodic broadcasting are introduced that are much more scalable than traditional unicast VoD systems. However the problem of designing an efficient server to implement these new multicast VoD architectures has received little attention. While existing server designs using round-based schedulers can still be used, results show that such designs are sub-optimal as they do not exploit the characteristics of fixed-schedule periodic broadcasting channels. This work addresses this challenge by presenting an efficient server design that can increase the system capacity by up to 60% compared to traditional video server designs.

The scalability and QoS was improved by means of pushing the streaming objects to the client sides in a CDNs-based streaming system, but the cost of deploying and maintaining was very high. However it was difficult to provide good QoS in a P2P-based streaming system due to the heterogeneous peers and arbitrary network connection of peers. Under the hybrid architecture proposed recently, this paper presents a new content delivery approach with which the streaming media is segmented, cached on proxy in CDNs and stored on peers in P2P dispersedly, hence it takes less resource of peers and be fairer.

Recent advances of transcoding technology make network-I/O bandwidth usages at the server communication ports controllable by request schedulers on the fly. In this article, we propose a transcoding-enabled bandwidth allocation scheme for service differentiation on streaming servers. It aims to deliver high bit rate streams to high priority request classes without overcompromising low priority request classes. We investigate the problem of providing differentiated streaming services at application level in two aspects: stream bandwidth allocation and request scheduling. We formulate the bandwidth allocation problem as an optimization of a harmonic utility function of the stream quality factors and derive the optimal streaming bit rates for requests of different classes under various server load conditions. We prove that the optimal allocation, referred to as harmonic proportional allocation, not only maximizes the system utility function, but also guarantees proportional fair sharing between classes with different prespecified differentiation weights. We evaluate the allocation scheme, in combination with two popular request scheduling approaches, via extensive simulations and compare it with an absolute differentiation strategy and a proportional-share strategy tailored from relative differentiation in networking. Simulation results show that the harmonic proportional allocation scheme can meet the objective of relative differentiation in both short and long timescales and greatly enhance the service availability and maintain low queueing delay when the streaming system is highly loaded.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Zhou, XB and Xu, CZ",2004,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS,10.1109/TPDS.2004.43,web-of-science-search1.bib

Furthermore, we develop a discrete event simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of the Evolutionary Game Theory framework.

Unfortunately, these applications are only briefly described and their source code is generally not available. Hence, making quick evaluations often involves rewriting complete applications on different platforms. The lack of a generic prototype application also makes it difficult for a developer to quickly evaluate the impact of some design choices. To address these issues, we present NAMB (Not only A Micro-Benchmark), a generic application prototype generator for DSP platforms. Given a high-level description of a stream processing application and its workload, NAMB automatically generates the code for different platforms. It features a flexible architecture which makes it easy to support new platforms. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposal to quickly generate application prototypes as well as benchmarks used in published papers. Overall, our approach provides easily replicable, comparable and customizable prototypes for data stream platforms. Moreover, NAMB provides similar performance in terms of latency and throughput to existing benchmarks, while only requiring a simple high-level description.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,INCLUDED,INCLUDED,,,"Pagliari, Alessio and Huet, Fabrice and Urvoy-Keller, Guillaume",2020,"2020 20TH IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CLUSTER, CLOUD AND INTERNET COMPUTING (CCGRID 2020)",10.1109/CCGrid49817.2020.00-87,web-of-science-search1.bib

The aforementioned problem is studied under the context of internet of things (IoT), where servers belonging to micro-datacenters are placed at network edges and thus close to data. We propose two algorithms to tackle the aforementioned problem taking into account limited server and network resources at microdatacenters. The first algorithm is called Delay Aware Algorithm (DA) and results in a delay efficient assignment without taking into account energy consumption.

However, finding an optimal scheduling algorithm for these systems is NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a heuristic scheduling algorithm for a heterogeneous cluster-T3 Scheduler-that can efficiently identify the communicating tasks and assign them to the same node, up to a specified level of utilisation for that node. Using three common micro-benchmarks and an evaluation using a real-world application, we demonstrate that T3-Scheduler outperforms current state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms, such as Aniello et al.'s popular `Online scheduler', improving throughput by 20-72% for micro-benchmarks and 60% for the real-world application.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Eskandari, Leila and Mair, Jason and Huang, Zhiyi and Eyers, David",2018,EURO-PAR 2017: PARALLEL PROCESSING WORKSHOPS,10.1007/978-3-319-75178-8_6,web-of-science-search1.bib
WOS:000800208500019,OneOS: Middleware for Running Edge Computing Applications as Distributed POSIX Pipelines,"Edge computing application developers often need to employ a combination of software tools in order to deal with the challenges of heterogeneity and network dynamism. As a result, developers write extra code irrelevant to the core application logic, to provide interoperability between interacting tools. Existing software frameworks offer programming models and cloud-hosted services to ease the overall development process. However, the framework-specific APIs exacerbate the technology fragmentation problem, requiring developers to write more glue code between competing frameworks. In this paper, we present a middleware called OneOS, which provides a distributed computing environment through the standard POSIX API. OneOS maintains a global view of the computer network, presenting the same file system and process space to any user application running in the network. OneOS intercepts POSIX API calls and transparently handles the interaction with the corresponding I/O resource in the network. Using the OneOS Domain-Specific Language (DSL), users can distribute a legacy POSIX pipeline over the network.

WOS:000468511200102,Radar: Reducing Tail Latencies for Batched Stream Processing with Blank Scheduling,"Real time processing of stream data has become increasingly vital. Batched stream systems which discretize stream data into micro-batches and leverage batch system to process these micro-batch stream jobs have attracted wide attention from academia and industry. Such batched stream system always works on heterogeneous environments which have heterogeneous resources and heterogeneous tasks. Unfortunately, current batched stream system implementations designed and optimized for homogeneous environments perform poorly on heterogeneous environments. We attribute suboptimal performance in heterogeneous environments to schedule tasks according to data locality and free slots. On the one hand, data locality creates a barrier between large tasks of slow node and powerful capacity of fast node because slow nodes prefer local large tasks rather than remote small tasks. On another hand, due to scheduler's blind eye to task size, there is a very high probability that large tasks are scheduled in the last few waves. These two aspects hinder perfect load balancing, causing tail latencies of large tasks. To address these issues, we propose a blank scheduling framework called Radar. Being aware of node capacity and task size, Radar pre-steals large tasks from slow nodes and schedules tasks according to the principle of large task first. Then Radar fills the small free slots by choosing small tasks corresponding to node's capacity. We implement Radar in Spark-2.1.1. Experimental results with benchmark show that Radar can reduce job completion time by 27.78% to 42.79% over Spark Streaming. Experimental results with real Tencent production application show that Radar can reduce response time by 28.57%.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Chen, Fei and Wu, Song and Jin, Hai and Lin, Liwei and Li, Rui",2018,IEEE 20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS / IEEE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SMART CITY / IEEE 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS (HPCC/SMARTCITY/DSS),10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00134,web-of-science-search1.bib

It can show large fluctuations in arrival frequency, size, complexity, and other factors. These fluctuations can strongly impact application latency and throughput, which are critical factors in this domain. Therefore, there is a significant amount of research on self-adaptive techniques involving elasticity or micro-batching as a way to mitigate this impact. However, there is a lack of benchmarks and tools for helping researchers to investigate micro-batching and data stream frequency implications. In this paper, we extend a benchmarking framework to support dynamic micro-batching and data stream frequency management. We used it to create custom benchmarks and compare latency and throughput aspects from two different parallel libraries. We validate our solution through an extensive analysis of the impact of micro-batching and data stream frequency on stream processing applications using Intel TBB and FastFlow, which are two libraries that leverage stream parallelism on multi-core architectures.

In this sense, high-level interfaces, encapsulating algorithmic aspects in pattern-based constructions, have considerably reduced the development and parallelization efforts of this type of applications. An example of parallel pattern interface is GRPPI, a C++ generic high-level library that acts as a layer between developers and existing parallel programming frameworks, such as C++ threads, OpenMP and Intel TBB. In this paper, we complement the basic patterns supported by GRPPI with the new stream operators Split-Join and Window, and the advanced parallel patterns Stream-Pool, Windowed-Farm and Stream-Iterator for the aforementioned back ends. Thanks to these new stream operators, complex compositions among streaming patterns can be expressed. On the other hand, the collection of advanced patterns allows users to tackle some domain-specific applications, ranging from the evolutionary to the real-time computing areas, where compositions of basic patterns are not capable of fully mimicking the algorithmic behavior of their original sequential codes. The experimental evaluation of the new advanced patterns and the stream operators on a set of domain-specific use-cases, using different back ends and pattern-specific parameters, reports considerable performance gains with respect to the sequential versions. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefits of the GRPPI pattern interface from the usability, flexibility and readability points of view. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, not many publications concentrate on a coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) for object inference algorithms. This paper provides a stream processing, dual-track programming CGRA-based approach to address the inherent computing characteristics of algorithms in object inference. Based on the proposed approach, an architecture called stream dual-track CGRA (SDT-CGRA) is presented as an implementation prototype. To evaluate the performance, the SDT-CGRA is realized in Verilog HDL and implemented in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation 55-nm process, with the footprint of 5.19 mm(2) at 450 MHz. Seven object inference algorithms, including convolutional neural network (CNN), k-means, principal component analysis (PCA), spatial pyramid matching (SPM), linear support vector machine (SVM), Softmax, and Joint Bayesian, are selected as benchmarks. The experimental results show that the SDT-CGRA can gain on average 343.8 times and 17.7 times higher energy efficiency for Softmax, PCA, and CNN, 621.0 times and 1261.8 times higher energy efficiency for k-means, SPM, linear-SVM, and Joint-Bayesian algorithms when compared with the Intel Xeon E5-2637 CPU and the Nvidia TitanX graphics processing unit.

By harvesting and collaborating a massive crowd of devices in close proximity for computation, communication and caching resource sharing (i.e., 3C resources), it enables great potentials in low-latency and energy-efficient IoT task execution. To efficiently exploit 3C resources of fog devices in proximity, we propose F3C, a fog-enabled 3C resource sharing framework for energy-efficient IoT data stream processing by solving an energy cost minimization problem under 3C constraints. Nevertheless, the minimization problem proves to be NP-hard via reduction to a Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP). To cope with such challenge, we propose an efficient F3C algorithm based on an iterative task team formation mechanism which regards each task's 3C resource sharing as a subproblem solved by the elaborated min cost flow transformation.

Such applications often require the reliable support of continuous real-time data streaming to deliver audio-visual data to end users. In conventional multimedia servers, storage and network controllers can operate independently and concurrently. Conflicting accesses to shared resources, such as the system bus and main memory are traditionally resolved by arbitration, which can hence affect a server's ability to deliver streams to the network concurrently. We use simulations to study a number of arbitration protocols and their effects on server performance in a video-on-demand scenario. Our findings suggest that these protocol yield comparable performance (parallel data streams), as long as storage controllers are not treated preferentially.

WOS:000529303200020,Multi-tenant Pub/Sub Processing for Real-Time Data Streams,"Devices and sensors generate streams of data across a diversity of locations and protocols. That data usually reaches a central platform that is used to store and process the streams. Processing can be done in real time, with transformations and enrichment happening on-the-fly, but it can also happen after data is stored and organized in repositories. In the former case, stream processing technologies are required to operate on the data; in the latter batch analytics and queries are of common use. This paper introduces a runtime to dynamically construct data stream processing topologies based on user-supplied code. These dynamic topologies are built on-the-fly using a data subscription model defined by the applications that consume data. Each user-defined processing unit is called a Service Object. Every Service Object consumes input data streams and may produce output streams that others can consume. The subscription-based programing model enables multiple users to deploy their own data-processing services. The runtime does the dynamic forwarding of data and execution of Service Objects from different users. Data streams can originate in real-world devices or they can be the outputs of Service Objects.

Due to ever-increasing traffic, distributed cache nodes can be deployed to store hot data and rapidly deliver them for consumption. However, prior work on caching policies has primarily focused on the potential gains in network performance, e.g., cache hit ratio and download latency, while neglecting the impact of cache on data processing and consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DeepChunk, which leverages deep Q-learning for chunk-based caching in wireless DPN. We show that cache policies must be optimized for both network performance during data delivery and processing efficiency during data consumption. Specifically, DeepChunk utilizes a model-free approach by jointly learning limited network, data streaming, and processing statistics at runtime and making cache update decisions under the guidance of deep Q-learning. It enables a joint optimization of multiple objectives including chunk hit ratio, processing stall time, and object download time while being self-adaptive under the time-varying workload and network conditions. We build a prototype implementation of DeepChunk with Ceph, a popular distributed object storage system.

Processing of such queries is challenging because, even when an object is not a top-k/w object at the time when it enters the processing system, it might become one in the future. Thus a set of potential top-k/w objects has to be stored in memory while its size should be minimized to efficiently cope with high data streaming rates. Existing approaches typically store top-k/w and candidate sliding window objects in a k-skyband over a two-dimensional score-time space. However, due to continuous changes of the k-skyband, its maintenance is quite costly. Probabilistic k-skyband is a novel data structure storing data stream objects from a sliding window with significant probability to become top-k/w objects in future. Continuous probabilistic k-skyband. maintenance offers considerably improved runtime performance compared to k-skyband maintenance, especially for large values of k, at the expense of a small and controllable error rate. We propose two possible probabilistic k-skyband usages: (i) When it is used to process all sliding window objects, the resulting top-k/w algorithm is approximate and adequate for processing random-order data streams. (ii) When probabilistic k-skyband is used to process only a subset of most recent sliding window objects, it can improve the runtime performance of continuous k-skyband maintenance, resulting in a novel exact top-k/w algorithm. Our experimental evaluation systematically compares different top-k/w processing algorithms and shows that while competing algorithms offer either time efficiency at the expanse of space efficiency or vice-versa, our algorithms based on the probabilistic k-skyband are both time and space efficient.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Pripuzic, Kresimir and Zarko, Ivana and Aberer, Karl",2015,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DATABASE SYSTEMS,10.1145/2736701,web-of-science-search1.bib
WOS:000861398600011,EdgeFaaSBench: Benchmarking Edge Devices Using Serverless Computing,"Due to the development of small-size, energy-efficient, and powerful CPUs and GPUs for single board computers, various edge devices are widely adopted for hosting real-world applications, including real-time object detection, autonomous driving, and sensor stream processing. At the same time, serverless computing receives increasing attention as a new application deployment model because of its simplicity, scalability, event-driven processing, and short-lived computation. Therefore, there is a growing demand for applying serverless computing to edge computing environments. However, due to the lack of characterization of serverless edge computing (e.g., application performance and impact from resource heterogeneity), researchers and practitioners have to conduct tedious measurements to understand the performance of serverless applications on edge devices in non-systematic ways. We create EdgeFaaSBench, a novel benchmark suite for serverless computing on edge devices, to bridge this gap. EdgeFaaSBench is developed on top of Apache OpenFaaS with Docker Swarm and can run various serverless benchmark workloads on edge devices with different hardware specifications (e.g., GPUs). EdgeFaaSBench contains 14 different benchmark workloads running on heterogeneous edge devices and captures various system-level, application-level, and serverless-specific metrics, including system utilization, response time, cold/warm start times, and impact of concurrent function executions. Experimental studies are conducted on two widely used edge devices, Raspberry Pi 4B and Jetson Nano, to show EdgeFaaSBench's capabilities to benchmark serverless computing on edge devices.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Rajput, Kaustubh and Kulkarni, Chinmay and Cho, Byungjin and Wang, Wei and Kim, In",2022,2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDGE COMPUTING & COMMUNICATIONS (IEEE EDGE 2022),10.1109/EDGE55608.2022.00024,web-of-science-search1.bib;ieee3-search1.bib

The problem is motivated by applications arising from distributed systems and computer networks. One example is large-scale distributed stream processing systems where TCP is used as the transport protocol for data transfer in between processing components. Other examples include reliable multicast in overlay networks, and reliable data transfer in ad hoc networks. Using an analytical approach, the paper establishes bounds on the asymptotic throughput of such a network. For a subclass of networks which are balanced, we obtain sufficient conditions under which the network stays scalable in the sense that the throughput is lower bounded by a positive constant as the network size increases. Necessary conditions of throughput scalability are derived for general networks. The special class of series-parallel networks is then studied in greater detail, where the asymptotic behavior of the throughput is characterized.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Xia, Cathy and Liu, Zhen and Towsley, Don and Lelarge, Marc",2007,SIGMETRICS Perform.

This paper describes a business process monitor for the recharging system of a mobile phone network provider. The monitored system is currently in operation for the major mobile phone company in Italy, namely Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM). Due to the amazingly high throughput of the monitored system, meeting the performance requirements for the monitor was a challenging issue. A buffer-based implementation of the monitor system failed to meet such requirements. In this paper, we propose a stream-based architecture, which exceeds the performance requirements imposed by the monitored application. The paper provides a detailed description of the monitor system architecture, including a discussion of technology choices, and an experimental evaluation of the performance boost achieved by resorting to a streaming approach.

WOS:000416492900011,A Holistic View of Stream Partitioning Costs,"Stream processing has become the dominant processing model for monitoring and real-time analytics. Modern Parallel Stream Processing Engines (pSPEs) have made it feasible to increase the performance in both monitoring and analytical queries by parallelizing a query's execution and distributing the load on multiple workers. A determining factor for the performance of a pSPE is the partitioning algorithm used to disseminate tuples to workers. Until now, partitioning methods in pSPEs have been similar to the ones used in parallel databases and only recently load-aware algorithms have been employed to improve the effectiveness of parallel execution. We identify and demonstrate the need to incorporate aggregation costs in the partitioning model when executing stateful operations in parallel, in order to minimize the overall latency and/or throughput. Towards this, we propose new stream partitioning algorithms, that consider both tuple imbalance and aggregation cost.

Characterizing common application behaviors can help for understanding performance aspects in the real-world scenario. One way to better understand and evaluate applications' characteristics is by using customizable/parametric benchmarks that enable users to represent important characteristics at run-time. We observed that parameterization techniques should be better exploited in the available benchmarks, especially on stream processing domain. For instance, although widely used, the stream processing benchmarks available in PARSEC do not support the simulation and evaluation of relevant and modern characteristics. Therefore, our goal is to identify the stream parallelism characteristics present in PARSEC. We also implemented a ready to use parameterization support and evaluated the application behaviors considering relevant performance metrics for stream parallelism (service time, throughput, latency). We choose Dedup to be our case study. The experimental results have shown performance improvements in our parameterization support for Dedup.

WOS:000823983100001,C3PO: Cloud-based Confidentiality-preserving Continuous Query Processing,"With the advent of the Internet of things (IoT), billions of devices are expected to continuously collect and process sensitive data (e.g., location, personal health factors). Due to the limited computational capacity available on IoT devices, the current de facto model for building IoT applications is to send the gathered data to the cloud for computation. While building private cloud infrastructures for handling large amounts of data streams can be expensive, using low-cost public (untrusted) cloud infrastructures for processing continuous queries including sensitive data leads to strong concerns over data confidentiality. This article presents C3PO, a confidentiality-preserving, continuous query processing engine, that leverages the public cloud. The key idea is to intelligently utilize partially homomorphic and property-preserving encryption to perform as many computationally intensive operations as possible-without revealing plaintext-in the untrusted cloud. C3PO provides simple abstractions to the developer to hide the complexities of applying complex cryptographic primitives, reasoning about the performance of such primitives, deciding which computations can be executed in an untrusted tier, and optimizing cloud resource usage. An empirical evaluation with several benchmarks and case studies shows the feasibility of our approach.

It turns out to be more challenging when simultaneous data acquisition from multiple sensors is required. This paper introduces a non-orthogonal multiple access technique MSMA, using extremely simple wireless and batteryless sensor tags and a reader to support concurrent streaming from multiple sensors. By simultaneously handling non-orthogonal subcarriers, produced either by multiple or single sensor tag, it can realize concurrent sensor data streaming, which can be used in health monitoring of machinery and civil structures. The paper explains the two primary challenges in MSMA, the optimal assignment of subcarrier frequencies and the unavoidable harmonics from one subcarrier to others. Since the mutual interference among subcarriers is unevenly distributed over the available frequency band, random allocation of subcarrier frequencies may result in degraded system performance. Results show that the interference can be canceled out with the signal processing technique and the system communication capacity can be increased significantly with a proposed heuristic approach compared to random allocation of subcarrier frequencies to the sensor tags.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Rajoria, Nitish and Kamei, Hiromu and Mitsugi, Jin and Kawakita, Yuusuke and Ichikawa, Haruhisa",2017,"2017 2ND IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS, SIGNAL PROCESSING AND NETWORKING (WISPNET)",,web-of-science-search1.bib

The methodology seamlessly integrates compiler, operating system, and hardware support to achieve a low-cost communication between synchronized producers and consumers. The technique is especially beneficial for data-streaming applications exploiting pipeline parallelism with computational phases mapped to separate cores. Code transformations utilizing a simple ISA support ensure that producer writes are propagated to consumers with a single interconnect transaction per cache block just prior to the producer exiting its synchronization region. Furthermore, in order to completely eliminate misses to shared data caused by interference with private data and also to minimize the cache energy, we integrate to the proposed framework a cache way partitioning policy based on a simple cache configurability support, which isolates the shared buffers from other cache traffic. This mechanism results in significant power savings since only a subset of the cache ways needs to be looked up for each cache access. The end result of the proposed framework is a single communication transaction per shared cache block between a producer and a consumer with no coherence misses on the consumer caches.

WOS:000311921300003,Efficient local search on the GPU-Investigations on the vehicle routing problem,"We study how to implement local search efficiently on data parallel accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units. The Distance-constrained Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, a computationally very hard discrete optimization problem with high industrial relevance, is the selected vehicle for our investigations. More precisely, we investigate local search with the Best Improving strategy for the 2-opt and 3-opt operators on a giant tour representation. Resource extension functions are used for constant time move evaluation. Using CUDA, a basic implementation called The Benchmark Version has been developed and deployed on a Fermi architecture Graphics Processing Unit. Both neighborhood setup and evaluation are performed entirely on the device. The Benchmark Version is the initial step of an incremental improvement process where a number of important implementation aspects have been systematically studied. Ten well-known test instances from the literature are used in computational experiments, and profiling tools are used to identify bottlenecks. In the final version, the device is fully saturated, given a large enough problem instance. A speedup of almost an order of magnitude relative to The Benchmark Version is observed. We conclude that, with some effort, local search may be implemented very efficiently on Graphics Processing Units. Our experiments show that a maximum efficiency, however, requires a neighborhood cardinality of at least one million. Full exploration of a billion neighbors takes a few seconds and may be deemed too expensive with the current technology. Reduced neighborhoods through filtering is an obvious remedy. Experiments on simple models of neighborhood filtering indicate, however, that the speedup effect is limited on data parallel accelerators.

WOS:000286677100007,QoS-Aware Dynamic Adaptation for Cooperative Media Streaming in Mobile Environments,"Media streaming is expected to be one of the most promising services in mobile environments. Effective data streaming management techniques are, therefore, in strong demand. In an earlier paper, the ideas and benefits of two-level cooperative media streaming with headlight prefetching and dynamic chaining were demonstrated {[}1]. Though complementary to each other, they operate in session-wide static and distinctive modes. Moreover, users do not have control over the quality and cost levels of the streaming services. The performance degradation or cost increment can reach an unacceptable level under fast or highly unstable moving patterns. In this paper, we propose the QoS-based dynamic adaptation techniques for the flexible employment and smooth integration of headlight prefetching and dynamic chaining to continuously provide quality streaming services to mobile users. The QoS-aware dynamic headlight prefetching is for the cooperation between streaming access points to dynamically adjust the prefetching scheme in response to the fast changing moving patterns. Adaptive P2P media streaming is for the cooperation between mobile users such that multiple peers can be used as streaming sources to increase the likelihood of successful chaining. Furthermore, a QoS-based technique is developed to dynamically trigger and proportionally adjust the prefetching degree when the stability and quality of P2P streaming service vary.

WOS:000364835300005,Cut-and-Rewind: Extending Query Engine for Continuous Stream Analytics,"Combining data warehousing and stream processing technologies has great potential in offering low-latency data-intensive analytics. Unfortunately, such convergence has not been properly addressed so far. The current generation of stream processing systems is in general built separately from the data warehouse and query engine, which can cause significant overhead in data access and data movement, and is unable to take advantage of the functionalities already offered by the existing data warehouse systems. In this work we tackle some hard problems in integrating stream analytics capability into the existing query engine. We define an extended SQL query model that unifies queries over both static relations and dynamic streaming data, and develop techniques to extend query engines to support the unified model. We propose the cut-and-rewind query execution model to allow a query with full SQL expressive power to be applied to stream data by converting the latter into a sequence of ``chunks{''}, and executing the query over each chunk sequentially, but without shutting the query instance down between chunks for continuously maintaining the application context across the execution cycles as required by sliding-window operators. We also propose the cycle-based transaction model to support Continuous Querying with Continuous Persisting (CQCP) with cycle-based isolation and visibility. We have prototyped our approach by extending the PostgreSQL. This work has resulted in a new kind of tightly integrated, highly efficient system with the advanced stream processing capability as well as the full DBMS functionality.

WOS:000261953900003,Cache-aware timing analysis of streaming applications,"Of late, there has been a considerable interest in models, algorithms and methodologies specifically targeted towards designing hardware and software for streaming applications. Such applications process potentially infinite streams of audio/video data or network packets and are found in a wide range of devices, starting from mobile phones to set-top boxes. Given a streaming application and an architecture, the timing analysis problem is to determine the timing properties of the processed data stream, given the timing properties of the input stream. This problem arises while determining many common performance metrics related to streaming applications and the mapping of such applications onto hardware architectures. Such metrics include the maximum delay experienced by any data item of the stream and the maximum backlog or the buffer requirement to store the incoming stream. Most of the previous work related to estimating or optimizing these metrics take a high-level view of the architecture and neglect micro-architectural features such as caches. In this paper, we show that an accurate estimation of these metrics, however, heavily relies on an appropriate modeling of the processor micro-architecture. Towards this, we present a novel framework for cache-aware timing analysis of stream processing applications. Our framework accurately models the evolution of the instruction cache of the underlying processor as a stream is processed, and the fact that the execution time involved in processing any data item depends on all the previous data items occurring in the stream. The main contribution of our method lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate program analysis techniques for micro-architectural modeling with known analytical methods for analyzing streaming applications, which treat the arrival/service of event streams as mathematical functions. This combination is powerful as it allows to model the code/cache-behavior of the streaming application, as well as the manner in which it is triggered by event arrivals.

The existing architecture-level power evaluation tools lose accuracy due to ignoring features of circuit-level behaviors and influences of process, voltage, and temperature variations. Although power estimations based on SPICE or PrimeTime PX (PTPX) are accurate enough, they come at the cost of long simulation time and are available only in very late phases of design flow. In this article, a fast and accurate dynamic power evaluation method is proposed, which estimates activity factors at the circuit level. The impact of process variation at the gate level is considered through the proposed effective capacitance model. Activity factors are then estimated by the model and input vectors of the circuit. Input vectors are generated by architecture-level simulations in the form of streaming. For real-time and high-speed power evaluation, a data streaming framework is proposed for massive parallelism. The cross-layer estimation is verified based on the functional units of PULPino processor running SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks.

WOS:000703983200018,Perph: A Workload Co-location Agent with Online Performance Prediction and Resource Inference,"Striking a balance between improved cluster utilization and guaranteed application QoS is a long-standing research problem in cluster resource management. The majority of current solutions require a large number of sandboxed experimentation for different workload combinations and leverage them to predict possible interference for incoming workloads. This results in non-negligible time complexity that severely restricts its applicability to complex workload co-locations. The nature of pure offline profiling may also lead to model aging problem that drastically degrades the model precision. In this paper, we present Perph, a runtime agent on a per node basis, which decouples ML-based performance prediction and resource inference from centralized scheduler. We exploit the sensitivity of long-running applications to multi-resources for establishing a relationship between resource allocation and consequential performance. We use Online Gradient Boost Regression Tree (OGBRT) to enable the continuous model evolution. Once performance degradation is detected, resource inference is conducted to work out a proper slice of resources that will be reallocated to recover the target performance. The integration with Node Manager (NM) of Apache YARN shows that the throughput of Kafka data-streaming application is 2.0x and 1.82x times that of isolation execution schemes in native YARN and pure cgroup cpu subsystem.

In particular, smart approaches to manage and analyze data directly on the network edge, are more and more investigated, and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered edge computing is envisaged to be a promising direction. In this article, we focus on data centers (DCs) and supercomputers (SCs), where a new generation of high-resolution monitoring systems is being deployed, opening new opportunities for analysis like anomaly detection and security, but introducing new challenges for handling the vast amount of data it produces. In detail, we report on a novel lightweight and scalable approach to increase the security of DCs/SCs, which involves AI-powered edge computing on high-resolution power consumption. The method-called pAElla-targets real-time malware detection (MD), it runs on an out-of-band IoT-based monitoring system for DCs/SCs, and involves power spectral density of power measurements, along with autoencoders. Results are promising, with an F1-score close to 1, and a false alarm and malware miss rate close to 0%. We compare our method with State-of-the-Art (SoA) MD techniques and show that, in the context of DCs/SCs, pAElla can cover a wider range of malware, significantly outperforming SoA approaches in terms of accuracy.

The exact formula for the mean response time of K = 2-way F/J requests derived under Markovian assumptions (R-2(F/J)) served as the starting point for an approximate expression for R-K(F/J) for 2 < K <= 32. When servers process independent requests in addition to F/J requests, the mean response time of F/J requests is better approximated by R-K(max), which is the maximum of the response times of tasks constituting F/J requests. R-K(max) is easier to compute and serves as an upper bound to R-K(F/J). We discuss techniques to compute R-K(max) and generally the maximum of K random variables denoting the processing times of the tasks of a parallel computation (X) over bar (max)(K). Graph models of computations such as Petri nets-a more general form of parallelism than F/J requests-are also discussed in this work.

The media streaming architecture is built upon a tree-structured network of super peers and the tree construction process has a significant impact on the overall system performance. We build network cost models and formulate a specific type of problem to maximize the minimum node throughput in Tree Construction (max-minTC), which aims at optimizing the system's stream rate by constructing an efficient spanning tree among super peers. We consider two scenarios: (i) When the overlay network has an arbitrary topology, we prove max-minTC to be NP-complete by reducing from the Degree Constrained Spanning Tree problem and propose an efficient heuristic algorithm. The performance superiority of the proposed algorithm is justified by experimental results collected by a live media streaming system deployed in real networks and is also illustrated by extensive simulations performed on a large set of simulated networks of various sizes from small to large scales in comparison with other methods, (ii) When the topology of the overlay network is complete, we rigorously prove that the same heuristic algorithm yields an optimal solution.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Lu, Xukang and Wu, Qishi and Li, Runzhi and Lin, Yunyue",2010,2010 Proceedings of 19th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks,10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560099,ieee1-search1.bib
5504759,A Methodology for the Systematic Evaluation of ANN Classifiers for BSN Applications,"While many BSN applications require that sensor nodes be able to operate for extended periods of time, they also often require the wireless transmission of copious amounts of sensor data to a data aggregator or base station, where the raw data is processed into application-relevant information. The energy requirements of such streaming can be prohibitive, given the competing considerations of form factor and battery life requirements. Making intelligent decisions on the node about which data to store or transmit, and which to ignore, is a promising method of reducing energy consumption. Artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers are among several competitive techniques for such data selection. However, no systematic metrics exist for determining if an ANN classifier is suited for a particular resource constrained computing environment of a typical BSN node. An especially difficult task is assessing, at the design stage, which classifier architectures are feasible on a given resource-constrained node, what computational resources are required to execute a given classifier, and what classification performance might be achieved by a particular classifier on a given set of resources. This paper describes techniques for quantifying and predicting the performance of ANN classifiers on wearable sensor nodes using scalable synthetic test data. Additionally, the paper shows a comparison of synthetic data with gait data collected using an inertial BSN node, and classification results of the gait data using a cerebellar model arithmetic computer (CMAC) architecture show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"PowellJr., Harry and Brandt-Pearce, Maïté and Barth, Adam and Lach, John",2010,2010 International Conference on Body Sensor Networks,10.1109/BSN.2010.48,ieee1-search1.bib

We propose and investigate an approach to all-digital LoS MIMO which addresses the difficulty of limited available precision for digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In order to reduce dynamic range requirements at the receiver, we consider spatially redundant transmit precoding (more transmit antennas than number of spatially multiplexed data streams) with 1-bit DACs. We introduce a novel approach for attaining the higher dynamic range required for precoding over the air (OTA), which we term OTA-DAC: the 1-bit DACs for clusters of transmit elements synthesize approximations to zero-forcing precoding across clusters. We illustrate our ideas for 64×4 and 16×4 LoS MIMO systems, comparing with a benchmark approach of 1-bit quantized ZF precoding for transmit elements evenly spaced across the aperture.

We present the real-world use case of unfiltered flood simulation data of such medium scale that need to be visualized in real time for scientific purposes. Our solution facilitates compute shaders to maintain a guaranteed watertight triangulation in GPU memory that approximates the interpolated heightfields with view-dependent, continuous levels of detail. In each frame, the triangulation is updated incrementally by iteratively refining the cached result of the previous frame to minimize the computational effort. In particular, we minimize the number of heightfield sampling operations to make adaptive and higher-order interpolations viable options. We impose no restriction on the number of subdivisions and the achievable level of detail to allow for extreme zoom ranges required in geospatial visualization.

The main challenge of this combination is the differentiation of service quality constraints between batch and stream computations. Stream processing is highly latency-sensitive while batch processing is more likely resource-intensive. In this work, we propose an end-to-end hybrid workflow scheduling on an edge cloud system as a two-stage framework. In the first stage, we propose a resource estimation algorithm based on a linear optimization approach, gradient descent search (GDS), and in the second stage, we propose a cluster-based provisioning and scheduling technique for hybrid workflows on heterogeneous edge cloud resources. We provide a multi-objective optimization model for execution time and monetary cost under constraints of deadline and throughput. Results demonstrate the framework performance in controlling the execution of hybrid workflows by efficiently tuning several parameters including stream arrival rate, processing throughput, and workflow complexity.

Existing network systems develop and expand both in terms of network size, load, and application traffic so the processing of a single IDS is not enough and imposed a high overload on the system. Therefore, there is a need for upgrading a novel IDS system to adapt to the new challenges. To improve the performance of the entire N-IDS system, the traditional way is to replace it with a higher performance server to meet the requirements of processing and storage or using several N-IDS systems. However, in those types of systems, the cost is often expensive but the processing and representation data real-time is still very limited and it does not meet the urgent requirements of security manager. In this paper, we propose novel architecture of distributed log processing and storage tools to improve N-IDS data processing. Our goal is to improve overall system performance and cost-efficient.

Edge computing-based stream processing techniques that optimize for low latency and high throughput provide a promising solution to ensure a rich user experience by meeting strict application requirements. However, manual performance tuning of stream processing applications in heterogeneous and dynamic edge computing environments is not only time consuming but also not scalable. Our work presented in this paper achieves elasticity for stream processing applications deployed at the edge by automatically tuning the applications to meet the performance requirements. The proposed approach adopts a learning model to configure the parallelism of the operators in the stream processing application using a reinforcement learning(RL) method. We model the elastic control problem as a Markov Decision Process(MDP) and solve it by reducing it to a contextual Multi-Armed Bandit(MAB) problem. The techniques proposed in our work uses Upper Confidence Bound(UCB)-based methods to improve the sample efficiency in comparison to traditional random exploration methods such as the e-greedy method. It achieves a significantly improved rate of convergence compared to other RL methods through its innovative use of MAB methods to deal with the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.

UARC is an example of an application that reliably streams data from a set of suppliers to a set of receivers. This comparison highlights the tradeoffs between ease of implementation and performance for a data streaming middleware service. By relying on a rigid language primitive, namely remote method invocation, the object based dissemination service gave up the control over its transport policies. In contrast, the lower level socket based service was specifically constructed to provide a flexible interface to its applications. This flexibility allowed the middleware to better support data delivery to a heterogeneous set of receivers.

9000079,AutoConfig: Automatic Configuration Tuning for Distributed Message Systems,"Distributed message systems (DMSs) serve as the communication backbone for many real-time streaming data processing applications. To support the vast diversity of such applications, DMSs provide a large number of parameters to configure. However, It overwhelms for most users to configure these parameters well for better performance. Although many automatic configuration approaches have been proposed to address this issue, critical challenges still remain: 1) to train a better and robust performance prediction model using a limited number of samples, and 2) to search for a high-dimensional parameter space efficiently within a time constraint. In this paper, we propose AutoConfig - an automatic configuration system that can optimize producer-side throughput on DMSs. AutoConfig constructs a novel comparison-based model (CBM) that is more robust that the prediction-based model (PBM) used by previous learning-based approaches. Furthermore, AutoConfig uses a weighted Latin hypercube sampling (wLHS) approach to select a set of samples that can provide a better coverage over the high-dimensional parameter space. wLHS allows AutoConfig to search for more promising configurations using the trained CBM. We have implemented AutoConfig on the Kafka platform, and evaluated it using eight different testing scenarios deployed on a public cloud. Experimental results show that our CBM can obtain better results than that of PBM under the same random forests based model.

We examined the first-order, the second-order, and the fourth-order stability of the multitask learning algorithm. The results identified conditions on the step-size parameter, regularization strength, and data characteristics in order to ensure stability.

Addressing another recent trend, we show the importance of our approach as a means to providing computational elasticity in multicore processor-based environments such that operators can automatically find their best operating point.

4802361,Investigating the Scheduling Sensitivity of P2P Video Streaming: An Experimental Study,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology has recently been employed to deliver large scale video multicast services on the Internet. Considerable efforts have been made by both academia and industry on P2P streaming design. While academia mostly focus on exploring design space to approach the theoretical performance bounds, our recent measurement study on several commercial P2P streaming systems indicates that they are able to deliver good user quality of experience with seemingly simple designs. One intriguing question remains: how elaborate should a good P2P video streaming design be? Towards answering this question, we developed and implemented several representative P2P streaming designs, ranging from theoretically proved optimal designs to straightforward ldquonaiverdquo designs. Through an extensive comparison study on PlanetLab, we unveil several key factors contributing to the successes of simple P2P streaming designs, including system resource index, server capacity and chunk scheduling rule, peer download buffering and peering degree.

4401052,How to scalably and accurately skip past streams,"Data stream methods look at each new item of the stream, perform a small number of operations while keeping a small amount of memory, and still perform much-needed analyses. However, in many situations, the update speed per item is extremely critical and not every item can be extensively examined. In practice, this has been addressed by only examining every Nth item from the input; decreasing the input rate by a fraction 1/N. but resulting in loss of guarantees on the accuracy of the post-hoc analyses. In this paper, we present a technique of skipping past streams and looking at only a fraction of the input. Unlike traditional methods, our skipping is performed in a principled manner based on the ""norm"" of the stream seen. Using this technique on top of well-known sketches, we show several-fold improvement in the update time for processing streams with a given guaranteed accuracy, for a number of stream processing problems including data summarization, heavy hitters detection and self-join size estimation. We present experimental results of our methods over synthetic data and integrate our methods into Sprint's Continuous Monitoring (CMON) system for live network traffic analyses.

8304764,A Fast and Power-Efficient Hardware Architecture for Visual Feature Detection in Affine-SIFT,"Visual feature detection has been widely used in many computer vision applications, with increasing concern on feature robustness, processing speed, and power efficiency. In comparison with popular feature detection algorithms, affine-SIFT achieves the strongest robustness on the image illumination, image rotation, and image scale transformation, but exhibits extreme high computation complexity. To improve its computing efficiency, this work first proposes three hardware optimization methods to address three main performance bottlenecks. The first method is the reverse affine-based pipelined computing with optimized memory accessing. The second method is about stream processing with full parallel Gaussian pyramid. The third method is the rotation invariant binary pattern based feature vector generation. Then by incorporating these three optimization methods, this paper designs a high-efficient pipelined and parallel hardware architecture with optimized parallel memory accessing. Postlayout simulations using TSMC 65-nm 1P9M low power process show that this work achieves a processing speed of 97 fps at 1080p (1000 feature points per frame on average) under 200 MHz, with power consumption at 300 mW. In comparison, its computing efficiency (1005.6K pixels/s at 1 MHz) and power efficiency (670.5K pixels/s at 1 mW) are higher than state-of-the-art works and it is more promising for broad vision applications especially the embedded vision and mobile vision applications.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Ouyang, Peng and Yin, Shouyi and Liu, Leibo and Zhang, Youguang and Zhao, Weisheng and Wei, Shaojun",2018,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers,10.1109/TCSI.2018.2806447,ieee2-search1.bib

Using pseudo-DHT, peers register their video contents information (key) with their network identity (value). To reduce retrieval latency, register (ldr) performs the alteration of a given key on a key collision. For retrieve (ldr), a query for a key returns a value associated with the key or a key closest to the key. We apply pseudo-DHT to P2TSS, a P2P system that provides both live and time-shifted streams. In P2TSS, a live video is divided and spread out in peers' buffers. Peers construct a chord overlay that serves as the base of pseudo-DHT. A theoretical analysis is presented to predict the search performance of P2TSS with pseudo-DHT.

In this paper, we demonstrate a system for stream processing that offers a high-level API to the users (similar to MapReduce), is fault-tolerant, and is also more efficient and scalable than current solutions. Particularly, a cost-efficient MPI/OpenMP based fault-tolerant scheme is incorporated so that the system can survive node failures with only a modest degradation of performance. We evaluate both the functionality and efficiency of Smart Streaming using four common applications in machine learning and data analytics.

Time-sensitive applications, include industrial, critical healthcare and transportation applications as also applications for Smart Grids and the Internet of Vehicles – one of the most active research fields of Intelligent Transportation Systems of Smart Cities. In this work, we mainly set our focus on the suite of safety applications which attracts strong interest from the research community, as it aims to avoid road accidents and save lives. The IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) set of standards specifies fundamental real-time characteristics. Nevertheless, as TSN works on Data Link layer (Layer 2 of the OSI model) the benefits of these characteristics fade away when other layers are crossed from the Application layer (Layer 7). Indicatively, recent research works report latencies on the order of tens of seconds when benchmarking Data Stream Processing and IoT platforms, and thus they are not suited for time-critical applications. Such platforms mainly use loosely coupled components with asynchronous communication.

5361399,Delay Bounds of Chunk-Based Peer-to-Peer Video Streaming,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems exploit the uploading bandwidth of individual peers to distribute content at low server cost. While the P2P bandwidth sharing design is very efficient for bandwidth-sensitive applications, it imposes a fundamental performance constraint for delay-sensitive applications: The uploading bandwidth of a peer cannot be utilized to upload a piece of content until it completes the download of that content. This constraint sets up a limit on how fast a piece of content can be disseminated to all peers in a P2P system. In this paper, we theoretically study the impact of this inherent delay constraint and derive the minimum delay bounds for P2P live streaming systems. We show that the bandwidth heterogeneity among peers can be exploited to significantly improve the delay performance of all peers. We further propose a conceptual snowball streaming algorithm to approach the minimum delay bound in a dynamic P2P networking environment. Our analysis and simulation suggest that the proposed algorithm has better delay performance and more robust than static balanced multi-tree-based streaming solutions.

When assembling components for a streaming application, it is often necessary to build translation blocks between them to match the ordering of the data elements required for the subsequent processing. This paper addresses this need by developing a technique that realizes arbitrary permutations in a streaming architecture. It is parametrized to accommodate any size data sequence and streaming width. This technique is applied to an architecture that receives continuous input at a rate of k elements per clock cycle, and after an initial start-up latency, outputs continuously at the same rate. In addition, the memory usage and latency through the memory array is minimized. This design is evaluated for permutations parametrized by size and stream width in terms of the memory elements and depths required. The class of stride permutation is considered for specific experimental evaluation.

6877240,Communication-Efficient Distributed Variance Monitoring and Outlier Detection for Multivariate Time Series,"Modern scale-out services are comprised of thousands of individual machines, which must be continuously monitored for unexpected failures. One recent approach to monitoring is latent fault detection, an adaptive statistical framework for scale-out, load-balanced systems. By periodically measuring hundreds of performance metrics and looking for outlier machines, it attempts to detect subtle problems such as misconfigurations, bugs, and malfunctioning hardware, before they manifest as machine failures. Previous work on a large, real-world Web service has shown that many failures are indeed preceded by such latent faults. Latent fault detection is an offline framework with large bandwidth and processing requirements. Each machine must send all its measurements to a centralized location, which is prohibitive in some settings and requires data-parallel processing infrastructure. In this work we adapt the latent fault detector to provide an online, communication- and computation-reduced version. We utilize stream processing techniques to trade accuracy for communication and computation. We first describe a novel communication-efficient online distributed variance monitoring algorithm that provides a continuous estimate of the global variance within guaranteed approximation bounds. Using the variance monitor, we provide an online distributed outlier detection framework for non-stationary multivariate time series common in scale-out systems. The adapted framework reduces data size and central processing cost by processing the data in situ, making it usable in wider settings. Like the original framework, our adaptation admits different comparison functions, supports non-stationary data, and provides statistical guarantees on the rate of false positives.

The tree construction process has a significant impact on the overall system performance. We formulate a specific type of problem, max-minTC, to maximize the minimum node throughput in tree construction, where the system's stream rate is optimized by constructing an efficient spanning tree among super peers. We present a decentralized approach where super peers run the same algorithm in parallel to derive a tree from an identical database describing the topology of the streaming system.

Supporting user interactivities such as random seek, rewind and fast forward is desirable while these operations surely introduce extra complexity and overhead into the VoD system. Moreover, users may probably have to wait for a long time because new data needs to be buffered and this would greatly deteriorate user experiences.

8644799,K-Means Clustering with Feature Selection for Stream Data,"K-means clustering is popular for its efficiency and is often chosen for analyzing large-scale data. However, it is hard to deal with high-dimensional data, which often contain lots of redundant features. In addition, in real-world applications, we usually confront with massive data streams, such as transport system and social media, which are often periodically generated in high-dimensional space. Although existing K-means extensions have achieved great success on high-dimensional data by integrating with dimension reduction methods, they are limited to off-line data. To solve these problems, we propose a streaming Kmeans clustering with feature selection.

7336545,Detection of Superpoints Using a Vector Bloom Filter,"Internet attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service attacks and worm attacks, are increasing in severity and frequency. Identifying and mitigating realtime attacks are an important and challenging task for network administrators. An infected host can make a large number of connections to distinct destinations during a short time. Such a host is called a superpoint. Detecting superpoints can be utilized for traffic engineering and anomaly detection. This paper proposes a novel data streaming method for detecting superpoints and proves guarantees on its accuracy with low memory requirements. The superior performance of this method comes from a new data structure, called vector bloom filter (VBF), which is a variant of standard BF. The VBF consists of six hash functions, four of which take some consecutive bits from the input string as the corresponding value, respectively. The information of superpoints is obtained by using the overlapping of hash bit strings of the VBF. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method can detect superpoints precisely and efficiently through comparison with other existing approaches.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Liu, Weijiang and Qu, Wenyu and Gong, Jian and Li, Keqiu",2016,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,10.1109/TIFS.2015.2503269,ieee2-search1.bib

MOL Stream allows P2P streaming protocols to be decomposed into basic blocks, each associated with a standard functional specification. By exposing structural commonalities between these components, MOL Stream enables specific implementations of these building blocks to be combined in order to devise, refine and evaluate new P2P live streaming protocols. Our approach offers several benefits. First, block encapsulation entails that more advanced individual components, e.g., the overlay, can seamlessly replace existing ones without affecting the rest of the system. As a case study, we show how MOL Stream can seamlessly substitute the overlay used by DONet/Coolstreaming, a popular P2P live streaming implementation, for an improved version. Second, MOL Stream facilitates the comparison between various protocols over local clusters or wide-area test beds such as Planet Lab. The combination of rapid prototyping and minimum effort valuation enables researchers and students to faster understand how various design choices at different levels impact the performance and scalability of the protocol, as shown through several examples in this paper.

Existing GPU frameworks do not support arbitrary irregular streaming dataflow tasks, and developing application-specific optimized implementations for such tasks requires expert GPU knowledge. We introduce MERCATOR, a lightweight framework supporting modular CUDA streaming application development for irregular applications. A developer can use MERCATOR to decompose an irregular application for the GPU without explicitly remapping work to threads at runtime. MERCATOR applications are efficiently parallelized on the GPU through a combination of replication across blocks and queueing between nodes to accommodate irregularity.

6413677,An Improvement of OpenMP Pipeline Parallelism with the BatchQueue Algorithm,"In the context of multicore programming, pipeline parallelism is a solution to easily transform a sequential program into a parallel one without requiring a whole rewriting of the code. The OpenMP stream-computing extension presented by Pop and Cohen proposes an extension of OpenMP to handle pipeline parallelism. However, their communication algorithm relies on Multiple-producer-Multiple-Consumer queues, while pipelined applications mostly deal with linear chains of communication, i.e., with only a single producer and a single consumer. To improve the performance of the OpenMP stream-extension, we propose to add a more specialized Single-Producer-Single-Consumer communication algorithm called Batch Queue and to select it for one-to-one communication. Our evaluation shows that Batch Queue is then able to improve the throughput up to a factor 2 on an 8-core machine both for example application and real applications. Our study shows therefore that using specialized and efficient communication algorithms can have a significant impact on the overall performance of pipelined applications.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Preud'Homme, Thomas and Sopena, Julien and Thomas, Gaël and Folliot, Bertil",2012,2012 IEEE 18th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems,10.1109/ICPADS.2012.55,ieee3-search1.bib

Although P2P streaming is scalable and robust, the network-oblivious peering and scheduling in the current designs impede the further improvement in streaming quality and the efficient usage of network resources. New P2P streaming systems exploit network information provided by Internet service providers (ISPs) to achieve a higher level of application performance and generate lower traffic stress. In this paper, utilizing information from ISPs, we investigate the strategies on the topology construction and maintenance of multi-tree based P2P streaming systems. We study topology optimization to minimize the average height of sub-stream trees and the average propagation latency in each tree.

We construct network cost models and formulate a Bandwidth Constrained Tree (BCT) construction problem, which aims at maximizing the number of peers that satisfy a specified bandwidth constraint.

6025323,A Survey and Synthesis of User Behavior Measurements in P2P Streaming Systems,"In terms of scalability, cost and ease of deployment, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) approach has emerged as a promising solution for video streaming applications. Its architecture enables end-hosts, called peers, to relay the video stream to each other. P2P systems are in fact networks of users who control peers. Thus, user behavior is crucial to the performance of these systems because it directly impacts the streaming flow. To understand user behavior, several measurement studies have been carried out over different video streaming systems. Each measurement analyzes a particular system focusing on specific metrics and presents insights. However, a single study based on a particular system and specific metrics is not sufficient to provide a complete model of user behavior considering all of its components and the impact of external factors on them. In this paper, we propose a comparison and a synthesis of these measurements. First of all, we review video streaming architectures, followed by a survey on the user behavior measurements in these architectures. Then, we gather insights revealed in these measurements and compare them for consensual and contrasting points.

It aims to rapidly analyze data as it streams in from many sources and make decisions with high speed and accuracy in fields as diverse as security surveillance and financial services including stock trading. We specifically consider real-time text indexing and search with high input data rates (10 GB/s or more) along with small index age-off (expiry) time. This makes it necessary to have maximal indexing rates for large volumes of data as well as minimal latency for indexing (time between start of indexing for a document and its availability for search) while maintaining very-low search response time. In addition, future massively parallel architectures with storage class memories will enable high speed in-memory real-time indexing, where index can be completely stored in a high capacity storage class memory. In this paper, we present the design of distributed data-structures and distributed real-time text indexing algorithm for parallel systems having large (thousands to hundred thousand) number of cores/processors, while simultaneously providing acceptable search performance [1]. The inherent trade-offs involved in index space, indexing throughput and search response time make this problem particularly challenging. Our algorithm uses group-based index construction and leverages novel index data structures that reduce load imbalance and make text indexing and merge process more scalable and efficient. We show analytically that the asymptotic parallel time complexity of our distributed indexing algorithm, is at least ?(log(P)) factor better than typical indexing approaches, where P is the number of indexing nodes in a group. We further demonstrate the performance and scalability of our distributed indexing algorithm, on an MPP architecture (Blue Gene/L) using actual IBM intranet data.

The former is inadequate as data are collected from different experiments, while the latter lacks a proper theoretical dynamics model. Our research aims at providing a general theoretical model to evaluate DS over P2P systems and analyze their dynamic behaviors. In this paper, with the analysis and abstraction of the characteristics of peers and their organization in DS over P2P, we propose a general population dynamics model for DS over P2P with fixed population. The model depicts the dynamic distribution of peers as a closed Markov queuing network. In particular, the model is scheme-independent and can be used with various schemes.

6038734,Efficient stereo segment scheduling in peer-to-peer 3D/multi-view video streaming,"3D (or stereo) video has been a visually appealing and costly affordable technology. More sophisticated multi-view videos have also been demonstrated. Yet their remarkably increased data volume poses greater challenges to the conventional client/server streaming systems, which has already suffered from supporting 2D videos. The stringent multi-stream synchronization further complicate the system design. In this paper, we present an initial attempt toward efficient streaming of stereo/multi-view videos over a peer-to-peer network. We show that the inherent multi-stream nature of stereo video makes segment scheduling more difficult, which is particularly acute with the existence of multiple senders in a peer-to-peer overlay. We formulate the stereo segment scheduling problem as a Binary Quadratic Programming problem and optimally solve it using an MIQP solver. However, given the high peer dynamics and the stringent playback deadline in real-time streaming, the optimal solution is too costly to be obtained. Thus, we develop two efficient algorithms to allow peers frequently compute the scheduling. We show that one of the proposed algorithms can achieve an analytical guarantee in the worst case performance, in particular, the approximation factor is at most 3 comparing with the optimal solution. We implement the proposed algorithms and the optimal in a peer-to-peer simulating system, and show that the proposed algorithms can achieve near-optimal performance efficiently. We further implement two other scheduling algorithms that are used in popular peer-to-peer streaming systems for comparison, and extend our design to support multi-view video with view diversity and dynamics.

Existing approaches either treat multiple application state monitoring tasks independently and build ad-hoc monitoring trees for each task, or construct a single static monitoring tree for multiple tasks. We argue that a careful planning of multiple application state monitoring tasks by jointly considering multi-task optimization and node level resource constraints can provide significant gains in performance and scalability. In this paper, we present REMO, a REsource-aware application state MOnitoring system. REMO produces a forest of optimized monitoring trees through iterations of two phases, one phase exploring cost sharing opportunities via estimation and the other refining the monitoring plan through resource-sensitive tree construction.

We consider a scenario where videos are hierarchically layered-encoded and most requests are negligibly overlapped in time. It implies that using multicast is not efficient, and instead, the streams are striped and allocated to multiple paths from the server to the client. To evaluate how well the rate-allocation algorithms approach optimality, we have earlier built a benchmarking system that provides the optimal solution for assigning available bandwidth to delivery paths. However, as video quality is not linearly related to bitrate, the trivial maximization of the total consumed bandwidth does not necessarily maximize the video quality. To address this problem, we define a metric that assesses video quality for a group of clients that we use as a utility function in the revised benchmarking system. Due to its concavity, this utility function distributes the bandwidth resources proportionally fair between the clients of the system.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Boudko, Svetlana and Leister, Wolfgang and Griwodz, Carsten and Halvorsen, Pål",2010,2010 IEEE 4th International Conference on Internet Multimedia Services Architecture and Application,10.1109/IMSAA.2010.5729398,ieee3-search1.bib
5425308,Scalability and Peer Churning in IP-TV: An Analytical Insight,"Abstract-Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology for TV broadcasting over the Internet is becoming more and more popular in the very last years. This paper introduces a network-wide metric to assess the efficiency of P2P streaming systems and develops a mathematical model to explain: (i) the scalability of such architectures with the number of peers, as evidenced by recent measurements; (ii) the initial decrement of efficiency (hence, quality) when a sharp increase in the number of peers in system occurs, as reported by experimental data. As for the second point, the proposed model builds upon the fundamental remark that when a peer first joins the system, it has no video content to share with others: its upload contribution is null for an initial time interval and the new peer behaves as a free rider. Three situations concerning the system reaction to the requests of the new entering peers are examined: full compensation; partial compensation; no reaction at all.

8113470,Dynamic Chameleon Authentication Tree for Verifiable Data Streaming in 5G Networks,"Chameleon authentication tree (CAT) is an important authenticated data structure for verifiable data streaming in 5G networks. But the typical CAT cannot support the dynamic scenario very well because it cannot expend freely since its height is fixed. Therefore, we proposed a dynamic CAT (DCAT) with the feature of adaptive expansion. We divided the algorithms of the DCAT with the following phases: setup, append, query, and verification. The DCAT removes the drawbacks of the static CAT. In the setup phase, it is not required for the scale of the tree to be determined, and the scale of the tree can be adaptively expanded during the data-appending phase. Therefore, the DCAT can suit the data stream environment better. During the data querying phase, the average authentication path length has been reduced, which leads to less space requirement and better verification efficiency. Finally, we performed theoretical analysis and drew a comparison between the static CAT and the DCAT in terms of performance. The result indicates that the DCAT provides improvements in the performance of the data-appending, data-querying, and data verification processes.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Xu, Jian and Li, Fuxiang and Chen, Ke and Zhou, Fucai and Choi, Junho and Shin, Juhyun",2017,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2771281,ieee3-search1.bib

5684743,Scalable video transmission over multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems,"With the proliferation of wireless services, multimedia interactivities are quickly becoming ubiquitous. As multimedia traffics generally have large packets volume, high data rate requirements in wireless transmission are critical. Next generation wireless systems, e.g., multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM), provide high throughput and support flexible resource management strategies for multimedia services. By fully exploiting spatial, temporal, and frequency diversities of MIMO-OFDM systems, intelligent resource allocation schemes can increase the overall performance of the multimedia streaming system significantly. In this paper, we describe a general framework of cross-layer resource allocation design for scalable video transmission over multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems. Scalable video coding provides an efficient solution for video adaptation to satisfy diverse requirements from heterogeneous mobile clients according to their system specifications and channel conditions. Generally, the base layer of a scalable video bitstream is more important than the enhancement layer as the enhancement layer can only be used for decoding if the base layer is available. Scalable video packets are entitled with different priorities in video reconstructions. Adaptation can be achieved by discarding some enhancement layer packets when network is congested. Based on the characteristics of scalable video, our objective is to optimize the overall system performance for multiple scalable video downlink over the Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA)-OFDM system from a multiple-antenna base station. Our cross-layer optimization is achieved by jointly linking packet prioritization from application layer and radio resource allocation at the physical layer. Based on packet priority of scalable video, time-frequency resource, power and modulation schemes are adaptively selected based on a prioritized water filling algorithm to maximize the overall system performance and to ensure fairness among different users. The performance of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by experimental comparisons with conventional radio resource allocation schemes.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Li, Maodong and Chen, Zhenzhong and Tan, Yap-Peng",2010,2010 5th International ICST Conference on Communications and Networking in China,,ieee3-search1.bib

Peer-assisted Video- on-Demand systems are designed to take full advantage of peer upload bandwidth contributions with a cache on each peer. Since the size of such a cache on each peer is limited, it is imperative that an appropriate cache replacement algorithm is designed. There exists a tremendous level of flexibility in the design space of such cache replacement algorithms, including the simplest alternatives such as Least Recently Used (LRU). Which algorithm is the best to minimize server bandwidth costs, so that when peers need a media segment, it is most likely available from caches of other peers? Such a question, however, is arguably non-trivial to answer, as both the demand and supply of media segments are stochastic in nature. In this paper, we seek to construct an analytical framework based on optimal control theory and dynamic programming, to help us form an in-depth understanding of optimal strategies to design cache replacement algorithms. With such analytical insights, we have shown with extensive simulations that, the performance margin enjoyed by optimal strategies over the simplest algorithms is not substantial, when it comes to reducing server bandwidth costs.

If nothing else, the (perceived) computational cost of model building under GP would preclude its application to tasks with non-stationary properties. Conversely, there is a rich history of applying GP to various tasks associated with trading agent design for currency and stock markets. In this work, we investigate the utility of a coevolutionary framework originally proposed for trading agent design to the related streaming data task of predicting individual household electric power consumption. In addition, we address several benchmarking issues, such as effective preprocessing of stream data using a candlestick representation originally developed for financial market analysis, and quantification of performance using a novel `area under the curve' style metric for streaming data. The computational cost of evolving GP solutions is demonstrated to be suitable for real-time operation under this task and shown to provide classification performance competitive with current established methods for streaming data classification.

9671517,A Scalable Linear-Time Algorithm for Horizontal Visibility Graph Construction Over Long Sequences,"The horizontal visibility graph (HVG) representation of a time series is a structured graph whose connectivity properties have been used to study the dynamics of a wide range of nonlinear systems. Applications range from the brain (EEG), the heart (ECG) and the financial markets (bid prices), to the sun (solar intensity readings) and river flows. HVGs have also been extended to image-based pattern recognition. Efficient and scalable online HVG construction is vital to extending HVG-based time series analysis to long, streaming, and distributed real-world time series data.The fastest scalable method for constructing HVGs today is the binary search tree (BST) encoding–decoding algorithm, which is O(n log n) in time series length for balanced data such as noise. However, in practice BST is highly sensitive to the geometric structure of a time series and its performance degrades significantly towards O(n2) when data possess long term dependencies or when the sample frequency is high, which occur regularly in practice. To avoid these problems we leverage an O(n) ordered rooted tree representation of time series that is (graph) dual to the HVG. We demonstrate that this representation leads to an algorithm for HVG construction that is agnostic with respect to the geometry and auto-correlations of the underlying data. Moreover, it possesses an efficient branch fusion operation for tree merging, leading to the idea of a bipartite HVG introduced in this paper, which allows HVGs for very large time series to be constructed efficiently in parallel.After introducing our method and algorithms for parallel construction of HVGs we report on experimental benchmarks comparing their real-world performance to existing approaches on long time series.

Previous work on estimating the flow size distribution for the complete population of flows has produced techniques that either make inferences from sampled network traffic, or use data streaming approaches. In this work, we identify and solve a more challenging problem of estimating the size distribution and other statistical information about arbitrary subpopulations of flows. Inferring subpopulation flow statistics is more challenging than the complete population counterpart, since subpopulations of interest are often specified a posteriori (i.e., after the data collection is done), making it impossible for the data collection module to ""plan in advance"".Our solution consists of a novel mechanism that combines data streaming with traditional packet sampling to provide highly accurate estimates of subpopulation flow statistics. The algorithm employs two data collection modules operating in parallel --- a NetFlow-like packet sampler and a streaming data structure made up of an array of counters. Combining the data collected by these two modules, our estimation algorithm uses a statistical estimation procedure that correlates and decodes the outputs (observations) from both data collection modules to obtain flow statistics for any arbitrary subpopulation.

However, realizing this potential benefit in practice requires accurate algorithms that can operate on high-speed links, with low CPU and memory requirements. In this paper, we investigate the problem of estimating the entropy in a streaming computation model. We give lower bounds for this problem, showing that neither approximation nor randomization alone will let us compute the entropy efficiently. We present two algorithms for randomly approximating the entropy in a time and space efficient manner, applicable for use on very high speed (greater than OC-48) links. The first algorithm for entropy estimation is inspired by the structural similarity with the seminal work of Alon et al. for estimating frequency moments, and we provide strong theoretical guarantees on the error and resource usage.

Each graph is a job, where nodes represent compute tasks and edges indicate data-flows between these compute tasks. Jobs (graphs) arrive randomly over time, and upon completion, leave the system. When a job arrives, the scheduler needs to partition the graph and distribute it over the servers to satisfy load balancing and cost considerations. Specifically, neighboring compute tasks in the graph that are mapped to different servers incur load on the network; thus a mapping of the jobs among the servers incurs a cost that is proportional to the number of ""broken edges''. We propose a low complexity randomized scheduling algorithm that, without service preemptions, stabilizes the system with graph arrivals/departures; more importantly, it allows a smooth trade-off between minimizing average partitioning cost and average queue lengths. Interestingly, to avoid service preemptions, our approach does not rely on a Gibbs sampler; instead, we show that the corresponding limiting invariant measure has an interpretation stemming from a loss system.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Ghaderi, Javad and Shakkottai, Sanjay and Srikant, Rayadurgam",2015,SIGMETRICS Perform.

10.1145/1379272.1379282,Optimizing Away Joins on Data Streams,"Monitoring aggregates on network traffic streams is a compelling application of data stream management systems. Often, streaming aggregation queries involve joining multiple inputs (e.g., client requests and server responses) using temporal join conditions (e.g., within 5 seconds), followed by computation of aggregates (e.g., COUNT) over temporal windows (e.g., every 5 minutes). These types of queries help identify malfunctioning servers (missing responses), malicious clients (bursts of requests during a denial-of-service attack), or improperly configured protocols (short timeout intervals causing many retransmissions). However, while such query expression is natural, its evaluation over massive data streams is inefficient.In this paper, we develop rewriting techniques for streaming aggregation queries that join multiple inputs. Our techniques identify conditions under which expensive joins can be optimized away, while providing error bounds for the results of the rewritten queries. The basis of the optimization is a powerful but decidable theory in which constraints over data streams can be formulated.

Previous work on estimating the flow size distribution has been focused on making inferences from sampled network traffic. Its accuracy is limited by the (typically) low sampling rate required to make the sampling operation affordable. In this paper we present a novel data streaming algorithm to provide much more accurate estimates of flow distribution, using a ""lossy data structure"" which consists of an array of counters fitted well into SRAM. For each incoming packet, our algorithm only needs to increment one underlying counter, making the algorithm fast enough even for 40 Gbps (OC-768) links. The data structure is lossy in the sense that sizes of multiple flows may collide into the same counter. Our algorithm uses Bayesian statistical methods such as Expectation Maximization to infer the most likely flow size distribution that results in the observed counter values after collision. Evaluations of this algorithm on large Internet traces obtained from several sources (including a tier-1 ISP) demonstrate that it has very high measurement accuracy (within 2%).

Unfortunately, when picking which streaming language to use, they face a difficult choice. On the one hand, dynamically scheduled languages allow developers to write a wider range of applications, but cannot take advantage of many crucial optimizations. On the other hand, statically scheduled languages are extremely performant, but have difficulty expressing many important streaming applications.This paper presents the design of a hybrid scheduler for stream processing languages. The compiler partitions the streaming application into coarse-grained subgraphs separated by dynamic rate boundaries. It then applies static optimizations to those subgraphs. We have implemented this scheduler as an extension to the StreamIt compiler. To evaluate its performance, we compare it to three scheduling techniques used by dynamic systems (OS thread, demand, and no-op) on a combination of micro-benchmarks and real-world inspired synthetic benchmarks. Our scheduler not only allows the previously static version of StreamIt to run dynamic rate applications, but it outperforms the three dynamic alternatives.

Under high load, SPEs aim to minimize output latency by leveraging sample processing for many applications that can tolerate approximate results. Sample processing limits input to only a subset of events such that the sample is statistically representative of the input while ensuring output accuracy guarantees. For queries containing window operators, sample processing continuously samples events until all events relevant to the window operator have been ingested. However, events can suffer from large ingestion delays due to long or bursty network latencies. This leads to stragglers that are events generated within the window's timeline but are delayed beyond the window's deadline. Window computations that account for stragglers can add significant latency while providing inconsequential accuracy improvement. We propose Aion, an algorithm that utilizes sampling to provide approximate answers with low latency by minimizing the effect of stragglers. Aion quickly processes the window to minimize output latency while still achieving high accuracy guarantees.

10.1145/1639562.1639596,A Distributed Data Streaming Algorithm for Network-Wide Traffic Anomaly Detection,"Nowadays, Internet has serious security problems and network failures that are hard to resolve, for example, botnet attacks, polymorphic worm/virus spreading, DDoS, and flash crowds. To address many of these problems, we need to have a network-wide view of the traffic dynamics, and more importantly, be able to detect traffic anomaly in a timely manner. To our knowledge, Principle Component Analysis (PCA)is the best-known spatial detection method for the network-wide traffic anomaly. However, existing PCA-based solutions have scalability problems in that they require O(m2 n)running time and O(mn)space to analyze traffic measurements from m aggregated traffic flows within a sliding window of the length n. We propose a novel data streaming algorithm for PCA-based network-wide traffic anomaly detection in a distributed fashion.

10.1145/3319498,Production Application Performance Data Streaming for System Monitoring,"In this article, we present an approach to streaming collection of application performance data. Practical application performance tuning and troubleshooting in production high-performance computing (HPC) environments requires an understanding of how applications interact with the platform, including (but not limited to) parallel programming libraries such as Message Passing Interface (MPI). Several profiling and tracing tools exist that collect heavy runtime data traces either in memory (released only at application exit) or on a file system (imposing an I/O load that may interfere with the performance being measured). Although these approaches are beneficial in development stages and post-run analysis, a systemwide and low-overhead method is required to monitor deployed applications continuously. This method must be able to collect information at both the application and system levels to yield a complete performance picture.In our approach, an application profiler collects application event counters. A sampler uses an efficient inter-process communication method to periodically extract the application counters and stream them into an infrastructure for performance data collection. We implement a tool-set based on our approach and integrate it with the Lightweight Distributed Metric Service (LDMS) system, a monitoring system used on large-scale computational platforms. LDMS provides the infrastructure to create and gather streams of performance data in a low overhead manner. We demonstrate our approach using applications implemented with MPI, as it is one of the most common standards for the development of large-scale scientific applications.We utilize our tool-set to study the impact of our approach on an open source HPC application, Nalu. Our tool-set enables us to efficiently identify patterns in the behavior of the application without source-level knowledge. We leverage LDMS to collect system-level performance data and explore the correlation between the system and application events. Also, we demonstrate how our tool-set can help detect anomalies with a low latency.

Typically, the events are logically partitioned by some key. For instance, the key can be the stock symbol in stock quotes, the author in tweets, the vehicle in transportation, or the patient in health-care. Composite event patterns often become meaningful only after partitioning. For instance, a pattern over stock quotes is typically meaningful over quotes for the same stock symbol. This paper proposes a pattern syntax and translation scheme organized around the notion of partitions. Besides making patterns meaningful, partitioning also benefits performance, since different keys can be processed in parallel. We have implemented partitioned parallel complex event processing as an extension to IBM's System S high-performance streaming platform. Our experiments with several benchmarks from finance and social media demonstrate processing speeds of up to 830,000 events per second, and substantial speedups for expensive patterns parallelized on multi-core machines as well as multi-machine clusters.

10.1145/1993498.1993559,Mining Hot Calling Contexts in Small Space,"Calling context trees (CCTs) associate performance metrics with paths through a program's call graph, providing valuable information for program understanding and performance analysis. Although CCTs are typically much smaller than call trees, in real applications they might easily consist of tens of millions of distinct calling contexts: this sheer size makes them difficult to analyze and might hurt execution times due to poor access locality. For performance analysis, accurately collecting information about hot calling contexts may be more useful than constructing an entire CCT that includes millions of uninteresting paths. As we show for a variety of prominent Linux applications, the distribution of calling context frequencies is typically very skewed. In this paper we show how to exploit this property to reduce the CCT size considerably.We introduce a novel run-time data structure, called Hot Calling Context Tree (HCCT), that offers an additional intermediate point in the spectrum of data structures for representing interprocedural control flow. The HCCT is a subtree of the CCT that includes only hot nodes and their ancestors. We show how to compute the HCCT without storing the exact frequency of all calling contexts, by using fast and space-efficient algorithms for mining frequent items in data streams. With this approach, we can distinguish between hot and cold contexts on the fly, while obtaining very accurate frequency counts. We show both theoretically and experimentally that the HCCT achieves a similar precision as the CCT in a much smaller space, roughly proportional to the number of distinct hot contexts: this is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the total number of calling contexts encountered during a program's execution. Our space-efficient approach can be effectively combined with previous context-sensitive profiling techniques, such as sampling and bursting.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"D'Elia, Daniele and Demetrescu, Camil and Finocchi, Irene",2011,SIGPLAN Not.,10.1145/1993498.1993559,acm2-search1.bib;acm2-search1.bib

10.14778/3402707.3402752,Massive Scale-out of Expensive Continuous Queries,"Scalable execution of expensive continuous queries over massive data streams requires input streams to be split into parallel sub-streams. The query operators are continuously executed in parallel over these sub-streams. Stream splitting involves both partitioning and replication of incoming tuples, depending on how the continuous query is parallelized. We provide a stream splitting operator that enables such customized stream splitting. However, it is critical that the stream splitting itself keeps up with input streams of high volume. This is a problem when the stream splitting predicates have some costs. Therefore, to enable customized splitting of high-volume streams, we introduce a parallelized stream splitting operator, called parasplit. We investigate the performance of parasplit using a cost model and experimentally. Based on these results, a heuristic is devised to automatically parallelize the execution of parasplit. We show that the maximum stream rate of parasplit is network bound, and that the parallelization is energy efficient.

al2019spatial,Spatial-aware approximate big data stream processing,"The widespread adoption of ubiquitous IoT edge devices and modern telemetry spewing out unprecedented avalanches of spatially-tagged datasets that if could interactively be explored would offer deep insights into interesting natural phenomena, which might remain otherwise illusive. Online application of spatial queries is expensive, a problem that is further inflated by the fact that we, more than often, do not have access to a full dataset population in non- stationary settings. As a way of coping up, sampling stands out as a natural solution for approximating estimators such as averages and totals of some interesting correlated parameters. In any sampling design, representativeness remains the main issue upon which a method is regarded good or bad. In a loose way, in a spatial context, this means fairly sampling quantities in a way that preserves spatial characteristics so as to provide more accurate approximates for spatial query responses. Current big data management systems either do not offer over-the-counter spatial-aware online sampling solutions or, at best, rely on randomness, which causes too many imponderables for an overall estimation.

While the consumer market is pushing them particularly as activity or heart rate trackers, their adoption in healthcare is still restricted to few cases, primarily due to their limited accuracy and reliability. An interesting field of application is the jump performance assessment. It is frequently used by therapists to estimate neuromuscular imbalances, since it helps to monitor training progress in athletes or injured patients. Measurements are typically captured with accurate but expensive instrumentation (e.g. force plates). In this work, we propose the use of a versatile low-cost wearable device equipped with inertial sensors for the evaluation of jump height, which can be easily employed at home. We consider two categories of jumps, the counter-movement jump (a single vertical jump) and the plyometric jump (the fast repetition of 4 jumps). The proposed approach, after an initialization phase, uses gyroscope data to continuously track the orientation of the device and align it with the vertical plane and the accelerometer data to estimate the jump trajectory. To validate the system, we collected 200 jumps performed with our device and the Myotest and we observed a mean difference of 0.7 cm (max. 1.9 cm) for the counter-movement jumps and 0.6 (max. 2.1 cm) for the plyometric jumps.",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Milosevic, Bojan and Farella, Elisabetta",2015,Proceedings of the 2015 workshop on Wearable Systems and Applications,,scholar.bib

Existing approaches of estimating the traffic matrix, based on statistical inference and/or packet sampling, usually cannot achieve very high estimation accuracy. In this work, we take a brand new approach in attacking this problem. We propose a novel data streaming algorithm that can process traffic stream at very high speed (e.g., 40 Gbps) and produce traffic digests that are orders of magnitude smaller than the traffic stream. By correlating the digests collected at any OD pair using Bayesian statistics, the volume of traffic flowing between the OD pair can be accurately determined. We also establish principles and techniques for optimally combining this streaming method with sampling, when sampling is necessary due to stringent resource constraints. In addition, we propose another data streaming algorithm that estimates flow matrix, a finer-grained characterization than traffic matrix. Flow matrix is concerned with not only the total traffic between an OD pair (traffic matrix), but also how it splits into flows of various sizes.

This is particularly suitable for applications in online analytics, monitoring, financial data processing and fraud detection that require timely processing of data, making the delay introduced by batch processing highly undesirable. This processing paradigm has led to the development of systems such as Yahoo! S4 [2] and Twitter Storm.2 Yahoo!

ryoo2008optimization,Optimization principles and application performance evaluation of a multithreaded GPU using CUDA,"GPUs have recently attracted the attention of many application developers as commodity data-parallel coprocessors. The newest generations of GPU architecture provide easier programmability and increased generality while maintaining the tremendous memory bandwidth and computational power of traditional GPUs. This opportunity should redirect efforts in GPGPU research from ad hoc porting of applications to establishing principles and strategies that allow efficient mapping of computation to graphics hardware. In this work we discuss the GeForce 8800 GTX processor's organization, features, and generalized optimization strategies. Key to performance on this platform is using massive multithreading to utilize the large number of cores and hide global memory latency. To achieve this, developers face the challenge of striking the right balance between each thread's resource usage and the number of simultaneously active threads. The resources to manage include the number of registers and the amount of on-chip memory used per thread, number of threads per multiprocessor, and global memory bandwidth. We also obtain increased performance by reordering accesses to off-chip memory to combine requests to the same or contiguous memory locations and apply classical optimizations to reduce the number of executed operations. We apply these strategies across a variety of applications and domains and achieve between a 10.5X to 457X speedup in kernel codes and between 1.16X to 431X total application speedup.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Ryoo, Shane and Rodrigues, Christopher and Baghsorkhi, Sara and Stone, Sam and Kirk, David and Hwu, Wen-mei",2008,Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and practice of parallel programming,,scholar.bib

peng2015data,A data streaming model in MPI,"Data streaming model is an effective way to tackle the challenge of data-intensive applications. As traditional HPC applications generate large volume of data and more data-intensive applications move to HPC infrastructures, it is necessary to investigate the feasibility of combining message-passing and streaming programming models. MPI, the de facto standard for programming on HPC, cannot intuitively express the communication pattern and the functional operations required in streaming models. In this work, we designed and implemented a data streaming library MPIStream atop MPI to allocate data producers and consumers, to stream data continuously or irregularly and to process data at run-time. In the same spirit as the STREAM benchmark, we developed a parallel stream benchmark to measure data processing rate. The performance of the library largely depends on the size of the stream element, the number of data producers and consumers and the computational intensity of processing one stream element. With 2,048 data producers and 2,048 data consumers in the parallel benchmark, MPIStream achieved 200 GB/s processing rate on a Blue Gene/Q supercomputer.

lenas2015bundle,"Bundle streaming service: design, implementation and performance evaluation","We present bundle streaming service (BSS), a communication framework that allows for reliable data streaming over delay/disruptive tolerant networks. BSS improves the reception and storage of data streams through the application of sophisticated forwarding tactics and the exploitation of inherent delay/disruptive tolerant networking (DTN) architecture features. The proposed framework, which targets easy configuration and deployment, comprises two elements: a bundle forwarder and a software library. Both elements were implemented as part of the interplanetary overlay network DTN platform. Using European Space Agency's DTN testbed, we experimentally evaluate BSS performance across a wide range of network scenarios. Based on these emulation results, we discuss the associated performance trade-offs along with potential improvement opportunities and demonstrate BSS's suitability for both terrestrial and space environments.

kross2017model,Model-based performance evaluation of batch and stream applications for big data,"Batch and stream processing represent the two main approaches implemented by big data systems such as Apache Spark and Apache Flink. Although only stream applications are intended to satisfy real-time requirements, both approaches are required to meet certain response time constraints. In addition, cluster architectures continuously expand and computing resources constitute high investments and expenses for organizations. Therefore, planning required capacities and predicting response times is crucial. In this work, we present a performance modeling and simulation approach by using and extending the Palladio component model. We predict performance metrics of batch and stream applications and its underlying processing systems by the example of Apache Spark on Apache Hadoop. Whereas most related work concentrates on one specific processing technique and focuses on the metric response time, we propose a general approach and consider the utilization of resources as well.

syafrudin2018performance,"Performance analysis of IoT-based sensor, big data processing, and machine learning model for real-time monitoring system in automotive manufacturing","With the increase in the amount of data captured during the manufacturing process, monitoring systems are becoming important factors in decision making for management. Current technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors can be considered a solution to provide efficient monitoring of the manufacturing process. In this study, a real-time monitoring system that utilizes IoT-based sensors, big data processing, and a hybrid prediction model is proposed. Firstly, an IoT-based sensor that collects temperature, humidity, accelerometer, and gyroscope data was developed. The characteristics of IoT-generated sensor data from the manufacturing process are: real-time, large amounts, and unstructured type. The proposed big data processing platform utilizes Apache Kafka as a message queue, Apache Storm as a real-time processing engine and MongoDB to store the sensor data from the manufacturing process. Secondly, for the proposed hybrid prediction model, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)-based outlier detection and Random Forest classification were used to remove outlier sensor data and provide fault detection during the manufacturing process, respectively. The proposed model was evaluated and tested at an automotive manufacturing assembly line in Korea. The results showed that IoT-based sensors and the proposed big data processing system are sufficiently efficient to monitor the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid prediction model has better fault prediction accuracy than other models given the sensor data as input.

vyas2022performance,Performance Evaluation of Apache Kafka–A Modern Platform for Real Time Data Streaming,"Current generation businesses become more demanding on timely availability of data. Many real-time data streaming tools and technologies are capable to meet business expectations. Apache Kafka is one of the capable open-source distributed scalable technology that enables real-time data streaming with good throughput and latency. In traditional batch processing, data is getting processed in groups or batches but in streaming services, data records are handled separately and there is a flow of data processing that is continuous and real-time. Once Data is available at the source, Kafka can detect and stream it in real-time to the target application. After doing the literature survey it was observed that there are insufficient experiments have been done till now with a variety of volumes and with different values of the number of partitions and polling intervals. The purpose of this study is to elaborate on Apache Kafka implementation and evaluate its performance. This study will analyse key performance indicators for the streaming platform and will provide useful insights from it. These insights will help to design optimized applications in Apache Kafka. Based on gaps identified after the literature survey, multiple experiments have been conducted for the producer and consumer API (Application Programming interface). Configuration of Kafka with Apache Zookeeper helped to drive the results which are captured in tabular form for different values of polling intervals, volumes, and partitions. Data for all test runs have been analysed further to drive the conclusions as mentioned in the results section. This study provides valuable insights about the utilization of CPU (Central Processing Unit) and memory for Apache Kafka streaming on changing volumes, also elaborates the impacts on streaming performance when key configurations are getting changed.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,INCLUDED,INCLUDED,EXCLUDED,duplicated w line 406,"Vyas, Shubham and Tyagi, Rajesh and Jain, Charu and Sahu, Shashank",2022,2022 2nd International Conference on Innovative Practices in Technology and Management (ICIPTM),,scholar.bib

However, the exponentially rising numbers of internet users is proving to be a real challenge to guarantee a good Quality of Service (QoS) for such applications. This paper investigates how video streaming quality is impacted by the increasing number of users using a video streaming application developed with Web Real Time Communications (WebRTC). The application considers both live video streaming from of an event captured by the initiator's webcam and live streaming of a video file from the initiator's device. Tests were performed using a Wi-Fi connection with different types of video sources. Moreover, equal cost load balancing was used to assess the impact on the video quality two servers are used at the initiator's site. Videos were recorded for five minutes on both the initiator and client sides using the application's record function and the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) was used to assess the quality of the videos. Results showed that with equal cost load balancing using two servers a maximum gain of up to 5.39 dB in PSNR could be obtained with live streaming from a webcam to ten clients.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,,,"Fowdur, TP and Anooroop, N and Beeharry, Y",2019,"2019 14th International Conference on Advanced Technologies, Systems and Services in Telecommunications (TELSIKS)",,scholar.bib

The closed-form expression is derived for the maximum secrecy rate of unicast transmission with high privacy. Furthermore, the positive secure capacity probability (PSCP) of unicast transmission is also obtained and analyzed. Our analytical results show that compared with high-mobility eavesdroppers, low-mobility eavesdroppers pose a greater threat to unicast secrecy.

 WOS:000619394400009,Dynamic Auto Reconfiguration of Operator Placement in Wireless  Distributed Stream Processing Systems,"The data is generated at significant speed and volume by devices in real-time. The data generation and the growth of fog and edge computing infrastructure have led to the noteworthy development of the corresponding distributed stream processing systems (DSPS). A DSPS application has Quality of Service (QoS) restrictions in terms of resource cost and time. The physical resources are distributed and heterogeneous. The resource-constrained scheduling problem has considerable implications on the performance of the system and QoS violations. The static deployment of applications in fog or edge scenario has to be monitored continuously for runtime issues, and actions have to be taken accordingly. In this paper, we propose an adaptation capability with reinforcement learning techniques to an existing stream processing framework scheduler. This functionality enables the scheduler to make decisions on its own when the system model or knowledge of the environment is not known upfront. The reinforcement learning methods adapt to the system when the system model for different states is not available. We consider applications whose workload cannot be characterized or predicted. In such applications, predictions of input load are not helpful for online scheduling. The Q-Learning based online scheduler learns to make dynamic scaling decisions at runtime when there is performance degradation. We validated the proposed approach with real-time and benchmark applications on a DSPS cluster. We obtained an average of 6% reduction in the response time and a 15% increase in the throughput when the Q Learning module is employed in the scheduler.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,EXCLUDED,"no year (Web of Science), duplicated",,,,,
